> The SharePoint Framework (SPFx) used a gulp-based toolchain from SPFx v1.0 - v1.21.1. SPFx v1.22 transitioned to a new Heft-based toolchain, replacing the previous dependency on gulp.  As part of this change, build toolchain configurations and customizations were also changed.

> Ensure you are following the correct guidance and documentation for toolchain used by version of SPFx you're. Learn more about the different toolchains:
