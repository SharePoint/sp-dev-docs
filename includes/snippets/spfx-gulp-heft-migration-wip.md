> [!NOTE]
> The SharePoint Framework (SPFx) used a gulp-based toolchain from SPFx v1.0 - v1.21.1. [SPFx v1.22 transitioned to a new Heft-based toolchain, replacing the gulp-based toolchain](../../docs/spfx/release-1.22.md).
>
> This article was originally authoring using a SPFx version that used the gulp-based toolchain. We're in the process of updating all affected articles and tutorials (including this page). Due to the number of articles and the age of SPFx, this will take time. At this time, this article has not yet been updated.
>
> Until the article has been validated, it's likely the steps on this page will work by simply replacing the gulp command with the Heft-based equivalent commands. For example, some commands remain unchanged (such as `package-solution`), some were replaced (such as `gulp serve` is now `heft start`), and some command arguments changed (such as `--ship` is now `--production`).
>
> Refer to the following page for more information on the the Heft commands and the corresponding gulp commands: [Understanding the Heft-based toolchain (how it works)](../../docs/spfx/toolchain/customize-heft-toolchain-overview.md).
