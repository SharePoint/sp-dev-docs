    Thank you for taking the time to file an issue. We periodically **archive** older or inactive issues as part of our issue management process, which automatically closes them once they are archived.  

    If youâ€™d like to understand more about why and how we handle archived (closed) issues, please see [Our approach to closed issues](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-docs/wiki/Issue-List#our-approach-to-closed-issues).  

    We appreciate your contribution and encourage you to check our active repositories or ask questions in the SharePoint developer community forums if you need further assistance.
