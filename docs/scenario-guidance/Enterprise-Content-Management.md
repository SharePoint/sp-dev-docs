# Enterprise Content Management

## Summary

SharePoint has been heavily used for Enterprise Content Management (ECM), since its very first release. Nowadays with SharePoint Online and SharePoint 2013/2016 on-premises there are a lot of services, capabilities, and options to manage ECM and content in SharePoint. This article is about all the available options and techniques.

## High-level guideline/general rules

Here follow some useful guidelines and general rules for ECM solutions:

* Avoid declaring Site Columns and Content Types in sub-sites, rather use the root site of a site collection to store all the Site Columns and Content Types of a hierarchy and then associate assets from root site to sub sites
* Rely on metadata, rather than on folders, to define a hierarchy of content
* Avoid renaming native fields like the *Title* field of items, rather use a custom column with a custom name as a suitable alternative
* Prefer a remote provisioning approach while provisioning the Information Architecture (IA), rather than using services like the Content Type Hub or other IA replication services
* If your deployment is in SharePoint Online, prefer using Microsoft Flow to design business processes, instead of using the Workflow engine of SharePoint 2010, or the Workflow Manager engine of SharePoint 2013/2016
* Avoid using the Publishing features on top of a Team Site, rather create a "modern" Communication Site

## Content Type Hub

_**Applies to:** SharePoint Online | SharePoint 2013 | SharePoint 2016_

A content type hub enables you to publish SharePoint content types across a farm. You can use a content type hub to centrally manage key content types that you want to use in multiple site collections.

Key challenge with the content type hub usage is that the replication of the content types is not immediate for the newly created site collections or when content types are updated in the hub. Replication can take quite a long time depending on your tenant size and amount of data where the content type hub assets are associated.

## Managed Metadata / Taxonomy

_**Applies to:** SharePoint Online | SharePoint 2013 | SharePoint 2016_

The Managed Metadata service (MMS) and the Managed Metadata fields allow to add custom metadata to items and documents. When you use SharePoint products, you can manage the metadata centrally. You can organize the metadata in a way that makes sense in your business and use the metadata to make it easier to find what you want.

## Document Sets

_**Applies to:** SharePoint Online | SharePoint 2013 | SharePoint 2016_

A Document Set is a group of related documents that you can manage as a single entity. You can create a Document Set in a single step, and then define its characteristics and metadata. You can manage the set as a single entity.

## Publishing

_**Applies to:** SharePoint Online | SharePoint 2013 | SharePoint 2016_

SharePoint Online includes a set of features that enables you to author and publish rich webpages for your intranet or Internet. These features are housed within the SharePoint Publishing Infrastructure and must be activated prior to use. You can activate them at either the site collection or site level. However, nowadays you should prefer creating "modern" communication sites and leverage their new layout to provide information portals to your users, rather than creating publishing sites or enabling the publishing features on team sites.

## Information Rights Management

_**Applies to:** SharePoint Online | SharePoint 2013 | SharePoint 2016_

Information Rights Management (IRM) helps prevent sensitive information from being printed, forwarded, saved, edited, or copied by unauthorized people. With IRM in SharePoint Online, you can limit the actions that users can take on files that have been downloaded from lists or libraries.

_**Applies to:** SharePoint Online | SharePoint 2013 | SharePoint 2016_

A record is a document or other electronic or physical entity in an organization that serves as evidence of an activity or transaction performed by the organization and that requires retention for some time period. Records management is the process by which an organization determines the rules for records.

## DocumentID Provider

_**Applies to:** SharePoint Online | SharePoint 2013 | SharePoint 2016_

Document ID allows to assign a unique identifier to documents. However, the technique to assign the ID differs depending if you are in SharePoint Online or in SharePoint 2013/2016 on-premises.

## Information Management Policies

_**Applies to:** SharePoint Online | SharePoint 2013 | SharePoint 2016_

An information management policy is a set of rules for a type of content. Information management policies enable organizations to control and track things like how long content is retained or what actions users can take with that content. Information management policies can help organizations comply with legal or governmental regulations, or they can simply enforce internal business processes.

## Site Columns and Content Types

_**Applies to:** SharePoint Online | SharePoint 2013 | SharePoint 2016_

Site Columns and Content Types are fundamental to define the Information Architecture of a SharePoint solution. However, the approach to create Site Columns and Content Types is different between SharePoint on-premises and SharePoint Online. In the former scenario you can use the declarative XML (CAML), while in the latter case you use CSOM/REST.
