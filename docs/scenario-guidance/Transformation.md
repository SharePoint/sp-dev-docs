# Transformation

## Summary

Office 365 and SharePoint evolve continuously. As new capabilities are added, it might be necessary to update the existing configuration and customizations. Transforming your solutions can help you get more benefit out of using SharePoint and Office 365.

## High-level guideline/general rules

- Get a clear understanding of the model you are migrating to. It is possible, that transforming existing scenarios to new capabilities would yield bigger benefits than mapping existing artifacts to their new equivalents.
- Carefully examine your existing requirements. It is possible, that implementing them in the new model will turn out to be more costly than the benefits they offer.
- Before starting transformation, thoroughly assess your existing environment and solution and decide if everything is still relevant.
- Don't forget to include end-user adoption as a part of the transformation process. Users are used to working in a certain way and might need to be re-educated to work just as efficiently with the new solution.

## Transform from Farm solutions

_**Applies to:** SharePoint Server_

Typically, farm solutions are packaged as SharePoint solution package (WSP) files that contain assemblies, other non-compiled components, and an XML manifest file. A farm administrator uses Windows PowerShell, the STSADM command-line tool, or the SharePoint Central Administration website to install solution packages to the server environment. After a solution package is installed, the farm administrator can activate the solution to a specific Web application (or multiple Web applications, if you use the full-trust model).

## Transform from Script- and Content editor web parts

_**Applies to:** Office 365 and SharePoint Server_

Script- and Content Editor web parts are used to build SharePoint customizations primarily by citizen developers. With nothing more than site owner permissions, citizen developers can build compelling SharePoint customizations that add business value. Whenever the customization needs to be updated, users with the necessary permissions can apply updates to the solution's script files and the changes are immediately visible to all users.

Script- and Content Editor web part solutions make it hard for IT organizations to keep track of what customizations are being used and where they are being used. Additionally, organizations can't tell which external scripts are being used in their intranet and have access to their data.

## Transform from Sandboxed solutions

_**Applies to:** Office 365 and SharePoint Server_

Code-based sandbox solutions [were deprecated](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sharepointdev/2014/01/14/deprecation-of-custom-code-in-sandboxed-solutions/) back in 2014 and SharePoint Online has started the process to completely remove this capability. Code-based sandbox solutions are also deprecated in SharePoint 2013 and in SharePoint 2016.

When you deactivate your existing sandbox solution from your sites, any assets or files deployed using declarative options will not be removed however, the features in the sandbox solution will automatically be deactivated and the event receiver will be removed.

## transform from JSLink

_**Applies to:** Office 365 and SharePoint Server_

Client-side rendering or JSLink is a concept introduced with SharePoint 2013.  With the help of this concept, you can customize the look and feel of SharePoint out-of-the-box VIEW/ADD/EDIT FORM.

JSLink is a JavaScript file which will override the default view of your list with the help of logically defined in your custom JSLink file. You can include the JSLink JavaScript file under the Miscellaneous section of your list view web part.

JSLink works only with the classic SharePoint experience and cannot be reused with the modern SharePoint UI.
