# Long-running and scheduled operations

## Summary

Use timer jobs in SharePoint to perform background tasks to manage or govern your environment, such as displaying a message on the site when certain criteria are not met, or enforcing retention policies or running scheduled processes that are processor-intensive.

## High-level guideline/general rules

- Timer jobs should be implemented outside of SharePoint.
- Scheduling timer jobs should be implemented outside of SharePoint.
- Timer jobs should authenticate via a service account or OAuth.

## Available options

### Azure Functions

_**Applies to:** Office 365_

In this pattern, the long-running or scheduled operation is implemented in an Azure Function.

- Does not require additional hardware to run the Azure Function (scheduling and implementation code).
- Advantageous because it uses the Azure Function for scheduling as well as the implementation code, which makes it easy to manage in one location.
- Maximum timeout for execution is 10 minutes (default 5 minutes), which means that if your process takes longer thant that, alternative options should be considered.

### Azure WebJobs

_**Applies to:** Office 365_

In this pattern, the Azure WebJob handles the scheduling aspects associated with a timer job and includes the implementation code.

- Does not require additional hardware to run the Azure WebJob (scheduling and implementation code).
- Advantageous because it uses the Azure WebJob for scheduling as well as the implementation code, which makes it easy to manage in one location.

### PnP timer job framework

_**Applies to:** Office 365 and SharePoint Server_

The PnP timer job framework is a set of classes designed to ease the creation of background processes that operate against SharePoint sites. The timer job framework is similar to on-premises full trust code Timer Jobs (`SPJobDefinition`). The primary difference with between the timer job framework and the full trust code Timer Job is that the timer job framework only uses client side APIs and therefore can (and should) be run outside of SharePoint. The timer job framework makes it possible to build Timer Jobs that operate against SharePoint Online.

### Windows scheduled tasks

_**Applies to:** Office 365 and SharePoint Server_

In this pattern, the Windows Scheduler handles the scheduling aspects associated with a timer job. Implementation code can be a console application or a PowerShell script or any other code that the Windows Scheduler can invoke.

### SharePoint TimerJobs

_**Applies to:** SharePoint Server_

A timer job is a trigger to start to run a specific Windows service for one of the Microsoft SharePoint Products and Technologies. It contains a definition of the service to run and specifies how frequently the service should be started. The Windows SharePoint Services Timer service (SPTimer) runs timer jobs. Many features in SharePoint Products and Technologies rely on timer jobs to run services according to a schedule.
