# Application Lifecycle Management

## Summary
Microsoft SharePoint gives developers several options for creating and deploying applications that are based on SharePoint Online, or SharePoint 2013/2016 on-premises. SharePoint offers increased flexibility in the shape applications can take as well as new options for using standards-based technologies with applications. However, developers must be able to infuse quality, testing and Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) considerations into the development process. In this article you can find some useful references to the available options in the fields of ALM while developing SharePoint technologies.

## Available options

### SharePoint Add-Ins

_**Applies to:** SharePoint Online | SharePoint 2013 | SharePoint 2016_

The SharePoint Add-In Model introduces new development techniques, mainly based on client-side code. Thus, the ALM of SharePoint Add-In solutions is slightly different from the previous Sandbox or Full Trust Code (FTC) solutions. Here follow articles and videos about how to manage ALM with the SharePoint Add-In model.

### SharePoint Framework

_**Applies to:** Office 365 | SharePoint Online | SharePoint 2016 (FP2)_

The new development model of SharePoint Framework (SPFx) introduces new tools and techniques to develop SPFx solutions. Here follows a list of useful articles about ALM with SPFx.
