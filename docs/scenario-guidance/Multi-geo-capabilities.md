# Multi-Geo Capabilities

## Summary
Multinational companies that have offices around the world often have needs to store their employee data at-rest in specific regions to meet their data residency requirements. The Multi-Geo Capabilities in Office 365, are a feature introduced in late 2017 that helps multinational customers address their regional, industry specific or organizational data residency requirements in Office 365.

Multi-Geo enables a single Office 365 tenant to span across multiple Office 365 datacenter geographies (geos), and gives customers the ability to store their Exchange, SharePoint, and OneDrive data, at-rest, on a per-user basis, in their chosen geos.

In this article you can find further details about the Multi-Geo Capabilities, as well as code samples, and videos.
