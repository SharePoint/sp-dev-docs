## SharePoint user profiles

_**Applies to:** Office 365 and SharePoint Server_

In SharePoint, user profiles represent SharePoint users. User profile properties represent information about the users and also about the properties themselves. For example, properties include the account name or email address of a user and the data type of a property. You can use the server object model to programmatically create, retrieve, and change user profiles, profile subtypes, and profile properties.+
