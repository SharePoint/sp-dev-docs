# SharePoint Developer Community - How to contribute

There are multiple ways to contribute to the SharePoint Developer Community (SharePoint PnP). Here are a few options:

* Participate in discussions within the [Microsoft Tech Community - SharePoint Developer group](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/SharePoint-Developer/bd-p/SharePointDev).
* Participate in the SharePoint community calls and provide input in the discussion during the calls.
* Do a live demo of your sample, solution, or architecture design in the SharePoint community calls.
* Report and fix issues within the GitHub repositories in the [SharePoint GitHub Organization](http://github.com/sharepoint).
* Report issues in the GitHub issue lists to help others find where they can assist.
* Provide input on new feature requests within [SharePoint Developer UserVoice](https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/forums/329220-sharepoint-dev-platform).

## FAQ

### Why would I contribute?

Contributing to the official articles, samples, and open-source projects ensures that your work will get the maximum visibility through the official channels from Microsoft. We will also acknowledge your contribution in the monthly summary (see Contributors in the [March 2018](https://dev.office.com/blogs/pnp-march-2018-update) update as an example). We will also acknowledge your company if you send your company logo and permission to use it to us.

### Why won't you link samples from my repositories?

This is due to liability reasons. Because samples are linked from the official SharePoint Developer portal, we need to ensure that we control the information published within the samples. We can't cross-link to non-Microsoft controlled repositories or articles because we don't control that content, and we need to guarantee that information remains available as long as it's cross-linked from Microsoft controlled sites.

If you contribute to the SharePoint GitHub organization, we'll absolutely make maintenance of your samples easy for you.

### I've built a cool SharePoint development sample; can I contribute it?

Absolutely. Just submit a pull request to the right GitHub repository and we'll get your contribution processed, typically, within a matter of days.

### We are working on cool guidance for SharePoint development; could we contribute that?

Absolutely. Guidance and articles are absolutely welcome where suitable. Let us know what you have and we can figure out the right model to get it published. There are some standards around how guidance is released, but we may be able to use our technical writers for any necessary voice review of your submissions.

### I'd like to help, but I'm not sure where to find suitable tasks or what to do.

Awesome! Here are a few suggestions:

* Help resolve some of the issues that are reported within the GitHub repositories.
* Submit new samples to the various repositories.
* Suggest a live demo in one of the community calls.

If you have other ideas on how you might contribute, don't hesitate to reach out and let us know.
