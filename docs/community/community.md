>
> **Do's & Dont's**: Interested in presenting during one of the community calls? Keep in mind these are community calls. The focus of these demos should be on learning and topics beneficial to the community. Please refrain from commercial activities such as selling or promoting products or services. Commercial activities in the community calls are not well received by the community and in certain instances may result in stopping the demo early. In your request to present, please be descriptive about what you intend to show to avoid any confusion. If you are not sure if what you want to present is appropriate, just ask in the submission.

## What’s the supportability statement around PnP open-source components and solutions?

Following statements apply across all of the SharePoint PnP assets, including samples, controls, component and solutions, like SharePoint Starter Kit or the PnP Provisioning Service.

- PnP assets are created by Microsoft & the community
- PnP assets are maintained by Microsoft & the community
- PnP uses supported and recommended techniques defined by Microsoft
- PnP is NOT a product and therefore it’s not supported by Premier Support or other official support channels, but if the experienced issue(s) is caused by out-of-the-box API, it falls on the normal support patterns from Microsoft side
- PnP is supported in similar ways as other open source projects done by Microsoft with support from the community by the community
- There are numerous partners that utilize PnP within their solutions for customers. Support for this is provided by the Partner. When PnP material is used in deployments, we recommend being clear with your customer/deployment owner on the support model
