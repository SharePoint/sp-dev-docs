# SharePoint Developer Community - Open-source projects

There are numerous open-source projects that are coordinated by the SharePoint PnP initiative. These are open-source, community-driven initiatives that are still closely involved with SharePoint engineering, but are not part of the standard product or service offerings.

## Supportability of open-source projects

The following statements apply across all of the SharePoint development (PnP) samples, reusable solutions, controls, and core components, and even the more polished solutions, such as the GDPR Activity Hub or the PnP provisioning engine:

* PnP guidance and samples are created by Microsoft and the community.
* PnP guidance and samples are maintained by Microsoft and the community.
* PnP uses supported and recommended techniques.
* PnP implementations are reviewed and approved by Microsoft engineering.
* PnP is an open source initiative by the community – people who work on the initiative for the benefit of others, and have their normal day job as well.
* PnP is NOT a product, and therefore it’s not supported by Premier Support or other official support channels.
* PnP is supported in similar ways as other open source projects done by Microsoft with support from the community by the community.
* There are numerous partners that utilize PnP within their solutions for customers. Support for this is provided by the Partner. When PnP material is used in deployments, we recommend being clear with your customer/deployment owner on the support model.
