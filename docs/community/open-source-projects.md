# SharePoint Developer Community - Open-source projects

There are numerous open-source projects which are coordinated by the SharePoint PnP initiative. These are open-source, community driven initiatives, which are still closely involved with SharePoint engineering, but are not part of the standard product or service offerings.

| Repository | Description |

| [GDPR Activity Hub](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-gdpr-activity-hub) | The GDPR Activity Hub is a starter kit for building a management hub for EU GDPR (European Global Data Protection Regulation). |
| [Office 365 CLI](https://sharepoint.github.io/office365-cli/) | The Office 365 CLI is a cross-platform command-line interface (CLI) that allows users on any platform to manage various configuration settings of Office 365. |
| [PnP CSOM Core](https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP-Sites-Core) | The Office 365 Developer PnP Core Component is an extension component which encapsulates commonly used remote CSOM/REST operations as reusable extension methods on out of the box CSOM objects.  |

The commands use CSOM and can work against both SharePoint Online as well as SharePoint On-Premises. |

## Supportability of these open-source projects

The following statements apply across all of the SharePoint Development (PnP) samples, reusable solutions, controls, core component(s), and even the more polished solutions, like the GDPR Activity Hub or the PnP Provisioning Engine:

* PnP guidance and samples are created by Microsoft & by the Community
* PnP guidance and samples are maintained by Microsoft & by the community
* PnP uses supported and recommended techniques
* PnP implementations are reviewed and approved by Microsoft engineering
* PnP is open source initiative by the community – people who work on the initiative for the benefit of others, have their normal day job as well
* PnP is NOT a product and therefore it’s not supported by Premier Support or other official support channels
* PnP is supported in similar ways as other open source projects done by Microsoft with support from the community by the community
* There are numerous partners that utilize PnP within their solutions for customers. Support for this is provided by the Partner. When PnP material is used in deployments, we recommend being clear with your customer/deployment owner on the support model
