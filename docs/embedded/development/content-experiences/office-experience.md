Office file experiences for SharePoint Embedded platform will work in a similar manner to Microsoft 365 platform.

## Opening Office documents from SharePoint Embedded

Office documents from SharePoint Embedded apps can be opened for viewing and editing in Office web, or in Office application for a richer viewing and editing experience.

## View or restore a previous version of Office document from SharePoint Embedded

Versioning is automatically enabled on each Word, Excel and PowerPoint file stored in your SharePoint Embedded Apps that helps your users to see what changes have been made in a file, compare different versions, or restore the version you want. This is incredibly important to your users if a mistake was made, a previous version is preferred or in multi-user coauthoring scenarios when your users are collaborating with others and someone makes changes your users didn't want in a file.

## Collaborating on Office documents from SharePoint Embedded

## Breadcrumb properties on Office documents from SharePoint Embedded

Breadcrumb properties are used by Office clients to display breadcrumb-style elements within Office client UI that aid your users in associating Office files with your Application.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend specifying 'Current Channel' to take advantage of Breadcrumb patterns and future enhancements to Office Apps. Learn more about [specifying update channels for Office Apps](/deployoffice/updates/overview-update-channels).

Breadcrumb patterns for SharePoint Embedded Application Apps are constructed from container properties configured for your Apps. The following diagram maps the container properties to breadcrumb presentation in Office clients:
