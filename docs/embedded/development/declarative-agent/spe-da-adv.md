# SharePoint Embedded agent Advanced Topics Overview

This advanced guide covers how the semantic index powers Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate, context-aware AI responses. We explore how these concepts work together to ensure your agent retrieves relevant information from your data and returns grounded answers.

## Caveats

### Configuration

#### Required Container Type Configuration

##### DiscoverabilityDisabled

The [`discoverabilityDisabled`](../../administration/developer-admin/dev-admin.md#container-type-configuration-properties) property controls whether Microsoft 365 can discover [drive items](/graph/api/resources/driveitem) within a specific container type.

If you’re updating an existing container type to set this property to `false`, allow up to **24 hours** for the configuration change to fully propagate before:

- Creating new containers,  
- Uploading files to containers, or  
- Using SPE agent to interact with folders or files.

This ensures the agent can correctly access and surface the content.

Here is an example of how to set `discoverabilityDisabled` to `false` with [Set-SPOContainerTypeConfiguration](/powershell/module/SharePoint-online/set-spocontainertypeconfiguration#examples)

```powershell
Set-SPOContainerTypeConfiguration -ContainerTypeId 4f0af585-8dcc-0000-223d-661eb2c604e4 -DiscoverabilityDisabled $false
```

Discoverability can also be disabled using the Visual Studio Code SharePoint Embedded extension

##### CSP Policies

The Content-Security-Policy (CSP) for embedded chat hosts ensures that only specified hosts can load the chat component. Specifically, the `CopilotEmbeddedChatHosts` setting is used in a [Content-Security-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) header as a `frame-ancestors` value. This helps in securing the application by restricting which domains can embed the chat component.

The SPE Administrator on the owning tenant can set this setting by using the `Set-SPOContainerTypeConfiguration` cmdlet:

```powershell
# Note this MUST be run in Windows PowerShell. It will not work in PowerShell.
Import-Module -Name "Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell"
Connect-SPOService "https://<domain>-admin.sharepoint.com"
# Login with your admin account.
# ...

Set-SPOContainerTypeConfiguration -ContainerTypeId XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX -CopilotEmbeddedChatHosts @("http://localhost:3000", "https://contoso.sharepoint.com", "https://fabrikam.com")

# This will set the container type configuration “CopilotEmbeddedChatHosts” accordingly. 
# Replication of this configuration on consuming tenants can take up to 24 hours
# ...

# Confirm setting value
Get-SPOContainerTypeConfiguration -ContainerTypeId XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX

# On a consuming tenant, you may confirm the setting value as follows
Get-SPOApplication -OwningApplicationId <OwningApplicationId> | Select-Object CopilotEmbeddedChatHosts

OwningApplicationId             : <OwningApplicationId>
OwningApplicationName           : SharePoint Embedded App
Applications                    : {<OwningApplicationId>}
CopilotEmbeddedChatHosts        : {http://localhost:3000, https://contoso.sharepoint.com, https://fabrikam.com}
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> If this configuration isn't set, the [Content-Security-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) is by default set to
> [frame-ancestors](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors): "none", which means no one can embed the agent.

A SharePoint Embedded Administrator on a consuming tenant may override the values specified by the owning application, by using the consuming tenant cmdlets:

- [Set-SPOApplication](/powershell/module/SharePoint-online/set-spoapplication) to set the `CopilotEmbeddedChatHosts` property.
- [Get-SPOApplication](/powershell/module/SharePoint-online/get-spoapplication) to get the `CopilotEmbeddedChatHosts` property.

> [!NOTE]
>
> A consuming tenant override must be a subset of what the owning tenant configured for `CopilotEmbeddedChatHosts`. An administrator
> in a consuming tenant cannot set values that the application owner has not specified for the container type. The override capabilities
> is intended for consuming tenant administrators to enable the agent in only a subset of hosts that the owning application has defined.

Here's an example of how a consuming tenant can override the setting:

```powershell
# Note this MUST be run in Windows PowerShell. It will not work in PowerShell.
Import-Module -Name "Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell"
Connect-SPOService "https://<domain>-admin.sharepoint.com"
# Login with your admin account.
# ...

Set-SPOApplication -OwningApplicationId  XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX -CopilotEmbeddedChatHosts @("https://contoso.sharepoint.com", "https://fabrikam.com") 

# This will set the container type configuration “CopilotEmbeddedChatHosts” accordingly
# Note that @("https://contoso.sharepoint.com", "https://fabrikam.com") is a subset of what we defined in the owning tenant
# Those values were @("http://localhost:3000", "https://contoso.sharepoint.com", "https://fabrikam.com")

# Confirm the configuration

Get-SPOApplication -OwningApplicationId <OwningApplicationId> | Select-Object CopilotEmbeddedChatHosts

OwningApplicationId             : <OwningApplicationId>
OwningApplicationName           : SharePoint Embedded App
Applications                    : {<OwningApplicationId>}
CopilotEmbeddedChatHosts        : {https://contoso.sharepoint.com, https://fabrikam.com}
```

#### Optional Configuration

##### Authentication and 3P Cookies

The `iframe` used by SharePoint Embedded agent authenticates users using third-party cookies. If third-party cookies are disabled in the user's browser, the iframe can't authenticate automatically. In this case, a popup prompts the user to sign in manually, ensuring that authentication can still be completed.

## Advanced Topics

### Application Scoping

Application scoping in SharePoint Embedded agent (SPE agent) involves defining the boundaries and context within which the tool operates, ensuring its features and capabilities are tailored to meet the specific needs of different applications. This process helps customize the agent's functionality, making it more effective and relevant for various use cases.

When SPE agent users query the LLM, it will only have access to files that the **User+Application** have access to. The effective permissions for the agent session will be the intersection of your SharePoint Embedded application's permissions and the user's permissions.

![Venn Diagram with SPE application access on left, SPE agent in middle and consuming tenant user on right, overlapped area is what agent can access](../../images/speco-appscopingvenn.png)

### Information Architecture

Files in SharePoint Embedded are naturally [semantic indexed](spe-da-adv.md#semantic-index). This semantic index underpins retrieval augmented generation [(RAG)](spe-da-adv.md#retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) workflows by providing relevant context from your stored content at query time. In essence, it [grounds](spe-da-adv.md#grounding) the AI responses, ensuring they directly reference accurate information in your containers rather than relying on general knowledge alone.

![How RAG works in SPE](../../images/speco-ragm365.png)

With SharePoint Embedded agent, you can further ground the large language models (LLM) response on [specific files or drive items.](spe-da-adv.md#scoping-your-agent-to-specific-content).

### Semantic index

[Learn more about semantic index for Microsoft 365 Copilot here](/microsoftsearch/semantic-index-for-copilot)

The semantic index allows for quick and accurate searches based on data similarity. This means it can find the most relevant information not just by exact matches, but also by understanding the context and meaning.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG enables you to reference relevant source materials stored in a repository at runtime. The data is retrieved from the index and is used to augment the prompt sent to the large language model (LLM). Some benefits of RAG​:

- Treat data sources as knowledge without having to train your model​
- Uses search (retrieval) results as additional context in your prompt​
- Generates the output using the prompt and the supplied context

The LLM uses the data to inform and construct the response.

### Grounding

Grounding in the context of SPE agent refers to the process of providing input sources to the large language model (LLM) related to the user's prompt. This helps improve the specificity of the prompt and ensures that the responses are relevant and actionable to the user's specific task. The data the agent is grounded on will be the contents of the container type in the agent application. Behind the scenes, SPE agent uses Microsoft 365 Copilot. [Learn more about Microsoft 365 Copilot architecture](/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-architecture).

### Scoping your agent to specific content

SharePoint Embedded (SPE) agent has the ability to restrict the data sources it has access to. The sample code below shows the available data source types. [This example](https://github.com/microsoft/SharePoint-Embedded-Samples/blob/main/Samples/spe-typescript-react-azurefunction/react-client/src/providers/ChatController.ts#L15) shows how to configure the SDK.

```typescript
export type IDataSourcesProps =
  | IFileDataSource
  | IFolderDataSource
  | IDocumentLibraryDataSource
  | ISiteDataSource
  | IWorkingSetDataSource
  | IMeetingDataSource;

export enum DataSourceType {
  File = 'File',
  Folder = 'Folder',
  DocumentLibrary = 'DocumentLibrary',
  Site = 'Site',
  WorkingSet = 'WorkingSet',
  Meeting = 'Meeting'
}
```

##### Language/Locale

The agent `iframe` dynamically loads localization settings to ensure that the chat interface is displayed in the appropriate language. These settings are derived from SharePoint, which provides a comprehensive set of localization options.

When the agent iframe is initialized, it retrieves the current localization settings from SharePoint. These settings dictate the language and regional preferences for the chat interface, ensuring that all UI elements, messages, and interactions are presented in the user's preferred language.

You can have this localized by setting your language options in the SharePoint account settings: [Change your personal language and region settings - Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/office/change-your-personal-language-and-region-settings-caa1fccc-bcdb-42f3-9e5b-45957647ffd7).

> [!NOTE]
>
> If your M365 language setting is different from your SharePoint account language setting, your M365 language setting takes precedence. You can change your M365 language setting here: [Change your display language in Microsoft 365](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/change-your-display-language-and-time-zone-in-microsoft-365-for-business-6f238bff-5252-441e-b32b-655d5d85d15b).

An additional locale option can be passed in through the `ChatLaunchConfig` to further set the language the agent responds in:

```typescript
 const [chatConfig] = React.useState<ChatLaunchConfig>({
        header: ChatController.instance.header,
        theme: ChatController.instance.theme,
        zeroQueryPrompts: ChatController.instance.zeroQueryPrompts,
        suggestedPrompts: ChatController.instance.suggestedPrompts,
        instruction: ChatController.instance.pirateMetaPrompt,
        locale: "en",
    });
```
