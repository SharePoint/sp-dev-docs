## Opening Office Documents from SharePoint Embedded Apps

Office documents from SharePoint Embedded Apps can be opened for Viewing and Editing in Office Online, where your users can work with documents directly on the website, or in Desktop apps for a richer viewing and editing experience. AutoSave feature saves your files automatically as your users work and is enabled for each Word, Excel and PowerPoint file stored in your SharePoint Embedded Application Apps.

## View or Restore a Previous Version of Office Document from SharePoint Embedded Apps

Versioning is automatically enabled on each Word, Excel and PowerPoint file stored in your SharePoint Embedded Application Apps which helps your users see what changes have been made in a file, compare different versions, or restore the version you want. This is incredibly important to your users if a mistake was made, a previous version is preferred or in multi-user coauthoring scenarios when your users are collaborating with others and someone makes changes your users didn't want in a file.

## Collaborating on Office Documents from SharePoint Embedded Apps

It's simple for your users to collaborate on your SharePoint Embedded Application's Office documents – they can **Share documents** with specific peers or with people outside your organization by Creating a shareable link to use wherever needed, Send an Email Invitation or @mention in comments to tag someone for feedback and , **Collaborate in real time** by co-authoring in Office with SharePoint Embedded Application Applications.

### Share your documents

#### Send an Email Invite

Share your SharePoint Embedded documents by Sending an email invitation to specific people:

- Select Share, start typing the email addresses or contact names of people you want to share with. When you begin to enter info in the box, you can also choose a contact from the list that appears.

#### Create a shareable link

Creating a shareable link makes it simple to share your SharePoint Emb document in an email, document, or IM.

- Select Share, Copy Link and Paste the link wherever you want

When you need help with a presentation, you can invite trusted peers to help you get it into shape. This means that when you work on a file, so can they. You’ll see their changes and they’ll see yours—as you make them! Use @mentions in comments to get someone's attention.

## Breadcrumb properties on Office Documents from SharePoint Embedded Application Apps

Breadcrumb properties are used by Office clients to display breadcrumb-style elements within Office client UI that aid your users in associating Office files with your Application.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend specifying 'Current Channel' to take advantage of Breadcrumb patterns and future enhancements to Office Apps. Learn more about [specifying update channels for Office Apps](/deployoffice/updates/overview-update-channels)

Breadcrumb patterns for SharePoint Embedded Application Apps are constructed from Container properties configured for your Apps. The following diagram maps the container properties to breadcrumb presentation in Office clients:
