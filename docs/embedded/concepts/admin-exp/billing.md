# SharePoint Embedded  Billing experience

This document outlines the steps an admin will have to follow to set up billing, evaluate actual and forecast costs, and pay invoices on SharePoint Embedded .

SharePoint Embedded  will be a consumption based PAYG (Pay-as-you-go) offering from SharePoint Online, which means you will pay only for what you use. As a Developer admin for SharePoint Embedded , you will set up billing on a container type using SharePoint Online Management Shell and manage forecast of actual costs and invoices in Microsoft Azure portal.

## Set up Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) for SharePoint Embedded

To enable PAYG on SharePoint Embedded, you need:

1. Existing SharePoint tenancy
1. An Azure subscription in the tenancy
1. A resource group attached to the azure subscription

## Roles and Permissions

- Admin who will set up billing relationship for SharePoint Embedded  will need to have owner or contributor permissions on Azure subscription.
- Admin will need to have a SharePoint administrator role to operate billing cmdlets.

## Steps to establish billing

1. Download and install the [latest version of SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=35588)
1. Open SharePoint Online Management Shell from **Start** screen, type **sharepoint**, and then click **SharePoint Online Management Shell**.
1. Connect to SPO service using `Connect-SPOService` cmdlet by providing admin credentials associated with tenancy. For information on [how to use Connect-SPOService](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/connect-sposervice), refer the linked documentation.
1. Create container type using `New-SPOContainerType` cmdlet by providing an **azure subscription**, **resource group** associated with the subscription and a **region**.

   1. If you do not have an azure subscription, you can create on by following steps here to [create an Azure subscription in your tenancy](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/initial-subscriptions)
   1. If you do not have a resource group, you can create on by following steps here to [create a resource group](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal)

```powershell
New-SPOContainerType -ContainerTypeName <ContainerTypeName>
                     -OwningApplicationId <OwningApplicationId>
                     -AzureSubscriptionId <AzureSubscriptionId>
                     -ResourceGroup <ResourceGroup>
                     -Region <Region>
```

## Applicable guidelines

1. Every container type must have an owning application.
1. A single owning app can only own one container type at a time.
1. An azure subscription can be attached to any number of container types.

## View/Edit billing properties

View the properties of billing. You can view properties of a ContainerType and associated billing properties by using one of the two PowerShell cmdlets:

1. To see all containertypes and billing properties except associated region:

    ```powershell
    Get-SPOContainerType
    ```

1. To see billing properties associated with a container type including region:

    ```powershell
    Get-SPOContainerType -ContainerTypeId <ContainerTypeId>
    ```

1. Update Azure subscription or resource group associated with a container type:

    ```powershell
    Set-SPOContainerType -ContainerTypeId <ContainerTypeId> [-AzureSubscriptionId <AzureSubscriptionId>] [-ResourceGroup <ResourceGroup>]
    ```
