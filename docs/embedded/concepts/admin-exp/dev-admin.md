# Developer Admin

## Overview

Organizations that create file management applications with the help of SharePoint Embedded are referred to as Developer Ecosystem (yet to be finalized), and the persona responsible for the management of the applications is called the developer administrator. Developer administrators can perform various administrative actions on the SharePoint Embedded applications created and on the Container types, the blueprint for the containers that hold the content of instances of the application. They can also create and manage trial container types to get started with the SharePoint Embedded experience, attach billing profiles to their application, etc. In this article, we describe the enterprise manageability features that are supported and can be performed by the developer administrator.

## Developer Admin Role

A Microsoft 365 SharePoint Administrator serves as the developer admin. Global Administrators in Microsoft 365 can assign users the SharePoint Administrator role. The Global Administrator role already has all the permissions of the SharePoint Administrator role. For information about assigning a user the SharePoint administrator role, see Assign admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

### Billing responsibilities of Developer admin

The developer admin will need to establish billing for SharePoint Embedded while creating container types given they have owner or contributor permissions on the Azure subscription that they use to establish the billing relationship on the product. To learn more about how to set up billing and manage cost and invoice, read about PAYG for [SharePoint Embedded.](./billing.md).

## Administration Tools

Developer admins will be able to manage SharePoint Embedded applications with PowerShell commands using SharePoint Online Management Shell.

To get started using PowerShell to manage SharePoint Embedded, you have to install the SharePoint Online Management Shell and connect to SharePoint Online.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need version 16.0.24211.12000 or higher to run the commands for SharePoint Embedded.

## PowerShell cmdlets for admin experience

### Creation of container types

Using PowerShell cmdlets, the developer administrator can create container types and attach it to an application ID (One to one mapping) and Azure subscription ID. The administrator can also create trial container types that have a validity of 30 days to get a feel of the standard container types. The following commands can be used to create SharePoint Embedded applications on the developer admin’s tenant:

```powershell
New-SPOContainerType -ContainerTypeName <ContainerTypeName> -OwningApplicationId <OwningApplicationId> -AzureSubscriptionId <AzureSubscriptionId> -ResourceGroup <ResourceGroup> -Region <Region>​
```

```powershell
New-SPOContainerType –TrialContainerType -ContainerTypeName <ContainerTypeName> -OwningApplicationId <OwningApplicationId>
```

OwningApplicationId is the ID of the SharePoint Embedded application. Azure Subscription ID is the ID of the Azure Active Directory profile (Microsoft Entra ID) for billing purposes.

### Viewing of container types

Using PowerShell cmdlets, the developer administrator can view container types and the corresponding applications created in their tenant. The following commands can be used to view SharePoint Embedded applications created on the developer admin’s tenant:

```powershell
Get-SPOContainerType​
Get-SPOContainerType -ContainerTypeId <ContainerTypeId>
```

### Manage properties of container types

Using PowerShell cmdlets, the developer administrator can change the properties of container types, both standard and trial. The following commands can be used to change the properties SharePoint Embedded applications created on the developer admin’s tenant:

```powershell
Set-SPOContainerType -ContainerTypeId <ContainerTypeId>
                     [-OwningApplicationId <OwningApplicationId>]
                     [-ContainerTypeName <ContainerTypeName>]
                     [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
```

## Manage billing profile of applications/ container types

Using PowerShell cmdlets, the developer administrator can change the billing profile of container types. The following commands can be used to change the properties SharePoint Embedded applications created on the developer admin’s tenant:

```powershell
Set-SPOContainerType -ContainerTypeId <ContainerTypeId>
                     [-AzureSubscriptionId <AzureSubscriptionId>]
                     [-ResourceGroup <ResourceGroup>]​[-WhatIf]
                     [-Confirm]
```

For more information about billing, see [Billing](./billing.md).

## Roles and Permissions

The user or admin who will set up billing relationship for SharePoint Embedded will need to have owner or contributor permissions on Azure subscription.

If you do not have an Azure subscription, follow steps here to [create a subscription](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/initial-subscriptions)

The user or admin will need to have a SharePoint administrator role to operate SPO PowerShell cmdlets.
