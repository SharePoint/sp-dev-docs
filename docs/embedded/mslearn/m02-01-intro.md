# Microsoft SharePoint Embedded: Building an app

SharePoint Embedded provides a faster way to build file and document focused apps. SharePoint Embedded are powered by SharePoint and make it easy for every developer, independent software vendor (ISV), and enterprise, to include critical Microsoft 365 file and document capabilities in every app they build.

In this module, youâ€™ll learn how to create a simple web application that demonstrates common scenarios and use cases developers can implement in their SharePoint Embedded enabled applications.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Create an Microsoft Entra ID application with necessary permissions to access SharePoint Embedded Containers.
- Create a Node.js-based REST API to handle CRUD tasks between a client-side app and SharePoint Embedded.
- Create a single-page React application that calls REST API to perform CRUD operations on an existing SharePoint Embedded Container.

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to a [Microsoft 365 tenant](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program?ocid=MSlearn).
- Admin access to a SharePoint Embedded Container.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18
- npm (*installed with Node.js)*
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- Intermediate experience of REST services and APIs.
- Intermediate experience of Microsoft Entra ID applications.
- Intermediate experience of OAuth2 authentication.
- Intermediate experience calling Microsoft Graph REST APIs.

## Next Steps

Let's get started and continue with the first topic in this tutorial, [Create SharePoint Embedded applications](m02-02-unit.md), where you'll walk through the initial creation of a web application capable of conducting CRUD operations on a SharePoint Embedded Container.
