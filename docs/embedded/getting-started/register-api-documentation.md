# Register file storage container type application permissions

In order for a SharePoint Embedded application to interact with containers in a consuming tenant, the container type must first be registered in the consuming tenant. Container type registration happens when the owning application invokes the registration API to specify how applications can access its container type. The registration API also grants access to other Guest Apps to interact with the owning application's containers. For example, a SharePoint Embedded application can grant permissions to another application--a Guest App so that the Guest App can perform backup operations against its containers.

Since the [container type registration API](/graph/api/filestorage-post-containertyperegistrations) controls the access to a container type in the consuming tenant, it's the first endpoint invoked by a SharePoint Embedded application on a consuming tenant. Failure to do so results in access denied errors when invoking other APIs against containers and/or content in the containers.

There are no restrictions on how many times the registration API can be invoked. How often the registration API is invoked and when it's invoked is dependent on the SharePoint Embedded application. However, the last successful call to the registration API determines the settings used in the consuming tenant.

## Authentication and authorization requirements

For the container type's owning application to act on a consuming tenant, some prerequisites must be completed:

- the owning app must have a service principal installed on the consuming tenant; and
- the owning app must be granted admin consent to perform container type registration in the consuming tenant.

You can satisfy these requirements by having the consuming tenant's Global Administrator [grant admin consent](/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/grant-admin-consent?pivots=portal) to the container type's owning application.

The [container type registration API](/graph/api/filestorage-post-containertyperegistrations) requires the `FileStorageContainerTypeReg.Selected` user-delegated or app-only permission. When the owning application calls the container type registration API on behalf of a user, the user must be assigned the [SharePoint Embedded Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#sharepoint-embedded-administrator) or the [Global Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-administrator) roles. When the owning application calls the container type registration API without a user context, it needs to request a token using the [client credentials grant flow](/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow).

> [!NOTE]
> The container type registration API is currently in preview and subject to change.

To request admin consent from a tenant administrator in the consuming tenant, you may direct them to the [admin consent endpoint](/entra/identity-platform/v2-admin-consent). For the right endpoints on national clouds, see [Microsoft identity platform endpoints on national clouds](/entra/identity-platform/authentication-national-cloud#microsoft-entra-authentication-endpoints):

```http
https://login.microsoftonline.com/{ConsumingTenantId}/v2.0/adminconsent?client_id={OwningAppId}&scope=https://graph.microsoft.com/.default
```

You may configure the admin consent endpoint to fit your needs, including handling errors and successful grants. For more information, see [Admin consent URI](/entra/identity-platform/v2-admin-consent).

## Container type Permissions

The registration API determines what permissions a SharePoint Embedded application can perform against containers and content in containers for the specified container type.
