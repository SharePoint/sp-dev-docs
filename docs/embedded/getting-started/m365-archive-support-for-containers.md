## Microsoft 365 Archive for SharePoint Embedded Containers (Preview)

Microsoft 365 Archive provides a cost-effective storage option for inactive or aging content stored in SharePoint Embedded containers.

Your organization and consuming tenants might need to retain data for extended periods to meet legal, compliance, or regulatory requirements. You might prefer to store the data in SharePoint to simplify searchability, security, compliance, and data lifecycle management.

Microsoft 365 Archive enables you to retain inactive SharePoint Embedded container data by moving it to a cold storage tier (archive) within SharePoint. Archived data continues to benefit from the same Microsoft 365 security, compliance, and search standards, while significantly reducing storage costs.

Microsoft 365 Archive is available for SharePoint sites. Detailed documentation is available here: <insert link>
