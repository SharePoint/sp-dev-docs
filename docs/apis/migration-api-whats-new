Check here to see what features or updates have been added to the Migration API. Here's a summary of what's included.  

##  Fixes

- **Changes to how Import API handles users**. As a response to issues arising from broken OneDrive scenarios when importing duplicate users, the API now blocks and detect duplicate user entries in UserGroup.xml.
