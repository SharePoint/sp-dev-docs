# Creating SharePoint Communication Site using REST

Learn how to create and get the status of a new modern SharePoint Communication site with the REST interface.

## Prerequisites

This topic assumes that you are already familiar with the topics Get to know the SharePoint REST service and Complete basic operations using SharePoint REST endpoints. It does not provide code snippets.

The following REST commands are available for creating a modern SharePoint Communication site.

- **Create** - Create a new SharePoint Communication site
- **Status** - Get the status of a SharePoint Communication site

The URL for communication site REST commands is based on `_api/sitepages/communicationsite`. For example, these are the endpoints for the commands listed above:

- `http:///_api/sitepages/communicationsite/create`
- `http:///_api/sitepages/communicationsite/status`

## Create Communication Site

```
url: /_api/sitepages/communicationsite/create
method: POST
body:
{
   "request":{
      "__metadata":{
         "type":"SP.Publishing.CommunicationSiteCreationRequest"
      },
      "AllowFileSharingForGuestUsers":false,
      "Classification":"LBI",
      "Description":"Description",
      "SiteDesignId":"6142d2a0-63a5-4ba0-aede-d9fefca2c767",
      "Title":"Comm Site 1",
      "Url":"https://vesku.sharepoint.com/sites/commsite132",
      "lcid":1033
   }
}
```

Note: New in this API is the concept of SiteDesignID. Much like the in-product site creation flow, the SiteDesignID parameter maps to the included site designs. They are:

- Topic: null
- Showcase: 6142d2a0-63a5-4ba0-aede-d9fefca2c767
- Blank: f6cc5403-0d63-442e-96c0-285923709ffc

**Response**

If successful, this method returns 200, OK response code and simple JSON object in the response body with following details.

```
{
  "d":{
      "Create":{
           "__metadata":{"type":"SP.Publishing.CommunicationSiteCreationResponse"},
          "SiteStatus":2,
          "SiteUrl":"https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/comm1"
      }
  }
}
```


## Get Communication Site Status

REST API for getting the status of a modern SharePoint Communication site

```
url: /_api/sitepages/communicationsite/status?url='https%3A%2F%2Fcontoso.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2Fcomm1'
method: GET
body: none
```

**Response**

If successful, this method returns 200, OK response code and simple JSON object in the response body with following details.
 
If the site exists, the response will return the site status and site URL.

```
{
  "d":{
      "Status":{
           "__metadata":{"type":"SP.Publishing.CommunicationSiteCreationResponse"},
          "SiteStatus":2,
          "SiteUrl":"https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/comm1"
      }
  }
}
```

If the site does not exist, the response will return site status of 0 with no URL.

```
{
  "d":{
      "Status":{
           "__metadata":{"type":"SP.Publishing.CommunicationSiteCreationResponse"},
          "SiteStatus":0,
          "SiteUrl":
      }
  }
}
```
