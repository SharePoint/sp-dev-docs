# SharePoint REST operations via the Microsoft Graph REST API

If you are looking for the legacy SharePoint REST API documentation, see [Complete basic operations using SharePoint REST endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/sp-add-ins/complete-basic-operations-using-sharepoint-rest-endpoints).

For SharePoint Online, innovation using a REST API against SharePoint is driven via the Microsoft Graph REST API's. In scenarios where a solutions already have access tokens available to access SharePoint content, it's possible to access the REST API nativly within SharePoint instead of calling via the Microsoft Graph API.

Below is a table outlining a set of the Microsoft Graph endpoints being backed by SharePoint Online.

|Graph URL|	SharePoint URL|
|----|----|
|https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites|	https://{tenant-name}.sharepoint.com/_api/v2.0/sites|
|https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/drives|	https://{tenant-name}.sharepoint.com/_api/v2.0/drives|
|https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/drive|	https://{tenant-name}.sharepoint.com/_api/v2.0/drive|
|https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/lists|	https://{tenant-name}.sharepoint.com/_api/v2.0/lists|

If your solution already uses other Microsoft Graph REST API's, it is recommended to call API's via the Microsoft Graph REST endpoints for easier code management.

To figure out if a Microsoft Graph REST API call is backed by SharePoint Online you can add `$whatif` to the end of the query to output the underlying SharePoint URL.
