# Manage modern SharePoint sites using REST

This topic assumes that you are already familiar with the following topics:

- [Get to know the SharePoint REST service](../sp-add-ins/get-to-know-the-sharepoint-rest-service.md)
- [Complete basic operations using SharePoint REST endpoints](../sp-add-ins/complete-basic-operations-using-sharepoint-rest-endpoints.md)

This topic does not provide code snippets. The REST examples below assume an HTTP Accept header of `application/json;odata.metadata=none`.

The following REST commands are available for creating a modern SharePoint Communication site:

- **Create**. Create a new SharePoint site.
- **Delete**. Delete a SharePoint site.
- **Status**. Get the status of a SharePoint site.

The base URL for the REST commands is `_api/SPSiteManager`.

## Create a modern site

Using the following REST API you can create both Communication sites and Non-group associated Team Sites.

To specify which type of site to create you use the `WebTemplate` attribute. Use one of the following templates to select which type of site to create:

- Communication Site: `SITEPAGEPUBLISHING#0`
- Non-group associated Team Site: `STS#3`

```json
url: /_api/SPSiteManager/create
accept: application/json;odata.metadata=none
odata-version: 4.0
method: POST
body:
{
  "request": {
    "Title": "Communication Site 1",
    "Url":"https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/commsite1",
    "Lcid": 1033,
    "ShareByEmailEnabled":false,
    "Classification":"Low Business Impact",
    "Description":"Description",
    "WebTemplate":"SITEPAGEPUBLISHING#0",
    "SiteDesignId":"6142d2a0-63a5-4ba0-aede-d9fefca2c767",
    "Owner":"owner@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com",
    "WebTemplateExtensionId":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you use an app-only context to create the site collection the **Owner property is required**. In other cases this is an optional property and if not present will default to the user calling the REST endpoint.


The site design id can be retrieved by using the [Get-SPOSiteDesign](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/get-spositedesign) (Microsoft SharePoint Online Management Shell) or [Get-PnPSiteDesign](/sharepoint/dev/declarative-customization/site-design-pnppowershell) (PnP PowerShell) cmdlets. If you want to apply an out-of-the-box available site design, use the following values:

- Topic: `96c933ac-3698-44c7-9f4a-5fd17d71af9e` or null
- Showcase: `6142d2a0-63a5-4ba0-aede-d9fefca2c767`
- Blank: `f6cc5403-0d63-442e-96c0-285923709ffc`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To apply your custom site designs as retrieved with [Get-SPOSiteDesign](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/get-spositedesign) (Microsoft SharePoint Online Management Shell) or [Get-PnPSiteDesign](/sharepoint/dev/declarative-customization/site-design-pnppowershell) (PnP PowerShell) you will have to change the JSON as follows:
```json
...
    "SiteDesignId":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "Owner":"owner@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com",
    "WebTemplateExtensionId":"<your site design ID>"
...
```
