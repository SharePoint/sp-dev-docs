# SharePoint Framework v1.5.1 release notes

This is mainly a bug fix release to address few regressions, which were introduced in the v1.5 release.

**Released:** June 26, 2018

## Upgrading projects from v1.5 to v1.5.1

1. In the project's **package.json** file, identify all SPFx v1.5 packages. For each SPFx package:
    1. Uninstall the existing v1.5 package:

        ```console
        npm uninstall @microsoft/{spfx-package-name}@1.5
        ```

    1. Install the refreshed v1.5.1 package:

        ```console
        npm install @microsoft/{spfx-package-name}@1.5.1.0 --save --save-exact
        ```
