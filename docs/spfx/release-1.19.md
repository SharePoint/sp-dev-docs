## Install the preview latest version

Install the latest preview release of the SharePoint Framework (SPFx) by using the **@next** tag.

### Webpack 5 support

The tooling was upgraded from Webpack 4 to Webpack 5.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have webpack configuration customizations in your project - reference the [official Webpack documentation](https://webpack.js.org/migrate/5/) for the migration details.

### Build time packages release is decoupled from the SPFx release

From this release forward, the build time packages are decoupled from the SPFx release. This means that the build time packages are released independently from the SPFx release. This change allows us to release new features and fixes to the build time packages without waiting for the next SPFx release.

This includes packages like `@microsoft/eslint-plugin-spfx`, `@microsoft/sp-module-interfaces`, and other similar build time packages.

### Optional footer for the Search Adaptive Card Extension

You can now skip `footer` for the Search adaptive card extension.

### `ariaLabel` property for the Property Pane's Checkbox control

`PropertyPaneCheckbox` now supports `ariaLabel` property.

### `imageAlt` property for the Property Pane's ChoiceGroup option

You can now specify `imageAlt` property for the Property Pane's choice group option.

### `ariaDescription` property for the Property Pane's Dropdown control

`PropertyPaneDropdown` now supports `ariaDescription` property.

### `disabled` property for the Property Pane's Icon Picker and Thumbnail Picker controls

`PropertyPaneIconPicker` and `PropertyPaneThumbnailPicker` now support `disabled` property.

### `inlineLabel` property for the Property Pane's Toggle control

`PropertyPaneToggle` now supports `inlineLabel` property that specifies whether the label (not the onText/offText) should be positioned inline with the toggle control. Left (right in RTL) side when on/off text provided vs. right (left in RTL) side when no on/off text.

> [!NOTE]
> When not providing on/off text user may get confused in differentiating the on/off states of the toggle.
