# SharePoint Framework roadmap

The first release of the SharePoint Framework contained only support for client-side web parts. This was, however, just a start on the journey for providing additional modern customization capabilities to SharePoint. Following is a list of key capabilities released after General Availability:

- [Tenant-scoped deployment support](./tenant-scoped-deployment.md)
- [On-premises support for SharePoint 2016 (Feature Pack 2)](./sharepoint-2016-support.md)
- [SharePoint Framework Extensions](./extensions/overview-extensions.md)
- [Tenant properties](./tenant-properties.md)
- [Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) APIs for SPFx solutions and add-ins](../apis/alm-api-for-spfx-add-ins.md)
- [Office UI Fabric Core support](https://dev.office.com/blogs/improved-support-for-office-ui-fabric-core)
- [Asset packaging and site collection App Catalog](../general-development/site-collection-app-catalog.md)


> [!NOTE]
> This is a list of areas that SharePoint engineering has in the backlog and is looking into. This does **NOT** mean that all of them will be delivered, but we are looking into getting items and topics from this list gradually released with the future releases of SharePoint Framework.

## General improvements
