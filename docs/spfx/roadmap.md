# SharePoint Framework roadmap

First release of the SharePoint Framework contained only support for client-side web parts. This was however just a start on the journey for providing additional modern customization capabilities to SharePoint. Here is a list of key capabilities released after initial General Availability.

- [Tenant scoped deployment support](./tenant-scoped-deployment.md)
- [On-premises support for SharePoint 2016 (Feature Pack 2)](./sharepoint-2016-support.md)
- [SharePoint Framework Extensions](./extensions/overview-extensions.md)
- [Tenant properties](./tenant-properties.md)
- [ALM APIs for SPFx solutions and add-ins](../apis/alm-api-for-spfx-add-ins.md)
- [Office UI Fabric Core support](https://dev.office.com/blogs/improved-support-for-office-ui-fabric-core)
- [Asset packaging and site collection app catalog](../general-development/site-collection-app-catalog.md)


> [!NOTE]
> This is a list of areas which SharePoint engineering is having in the backlog and are looking into. This does **NOT** mean that all of them will be necessarily delivered, but we are looking for getting items and topics from this list gradually released with the future releases of SharePoint Framework.

## General improvements

- Easy access to Graph API to access user specific information (GraphHttpClient in preview)
- Site level WebHooks
- Updated 'store' story with SharePoint Framework support

## Client-side web parts++ and add-ins

- Supporting more complex scenarios and interactions with web parts
    - Part-to-part communication
	- JS Framework isolation
    - "citizen developer" model for lightweight development

- Bring add-ins to the modern world: Letâ€™s make them play nicer with the new UX. 
    - Azure AD Registration
    - Native responsive support
    - Build Add-Ins with SharePoint Framework


## Application Lifecycle Management

- Streamlined approval experience: no need to know who your tenant admin is anymore

    - Tenant admin gets automatically notified 
    - Settings to control the default experience around approval process


## Developer Experience

### JavaScript embedding support (JSLink, User Custom Actions)
