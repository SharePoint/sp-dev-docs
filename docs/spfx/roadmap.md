# SharePoint Framework roadmap

The first release of the SharePoint Framework in February 2017 only contained support for client-side web parts. This was just a start on the journey to provide additional modern customization capabilities to SharePoint which we have provided since.

[!INCLUDE [sp-add-in-deprecation](../../includes/snippets/sp-add-in-spfx.md)]

Here's the current roadmap on the upcoming release:

**Version 1.22 – December 2025**

- Addressing npm audit reported security issues on the dependency tree.
- Transitioning from Gulp to an open webpack based toolchain orchestrated by Heft.

**Version 1.23 – March 2026**

- Open-sourcing SPFx solution templates via GitHub and opening them for community contributions.
- A new open-sourced SPFx CLI for replacing the existing Yeoman generator – You will be able to introduce your company specific templates or adjustments on the scaffolded baseline for the SPFx solutions. We are decoupling the CLI itself from the SPFx release versions.
- Command set improvements for lists and libraries – grouping and potentially other improvements.
- New and edit panel override in lists – support panel level override on the Microsoft Lists and SharePoint lists with SPFx.
- New debugging toolbar improving the in-page development experience when workbench is not used with direct feedback option to the feature crew.

**Version 1.24 – May 2026**

- Navigation customizers – Options to override navigation nodes and/or experiences with SPFx components.
- Other features which will be shared in following blog posts.

We also continue further innovation in the AI space with focus on both customer features and developer tooling. More on this with future updates.
