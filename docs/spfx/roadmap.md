# SharePoint Framework roadmap

First release of the SharePoint Framework will contain support for client-side web parts. This is however just a start on the journey for providing additional modern customization capabilities to SharePoint. This article lists the different areas which are in our backlog for the future releases of SharePoint Framework.

> Notice. This is a list of areas which SharePoint engineering is having in the backlog and are looking into. This does **NOT** mean that all of them will be necessarily delivered, but we are looking for getting items and topics from this list gradually released with the future releases of SharePoint Framework.  

## On-premises support

- Shipping as part of Feature Pack 2 for SharePoint 2016
- Similar feature capabilities as in SharePoint Online
- Target is to provide common development platform across on-premises and the cloud
- Leveraging modern toolchain and open source on on-premises environments

> SharePoint 2016 support for client-side web parts was shipped with SharePoint 2016 Feature Pack 2 during September 2017.

## General improvements

- Easy access to Graph API to access user specific information (GraphHttpClient in dev preview)
- Site collection app catalog with tenant level control for enabling easier solution deployed 
- Site level WebHooks

## Client-side web parts++ and add-ins

- Supporting more complex scenarios and interactions with web parts
    - Part-to-part communication
	- JS Framework isolation
    - "citizen developer" model for lightweight development

- Bring add-ins to the modern world: Letâ€™s make them play nicer with the new UX. 
    - Azure AD Registration
    - Native responsive support 
    - Build Add-Ins with SharePoint Framework

## JavaScript embedding support (JSLink, User Custom Actions)

- The same tool chain and deployment model as client-side web parts
- Derive from a strongly typed base class wherever possible rather than manipulating the page DOM directly.
- Enable modern extension usage with modern experiences similar as Custom Actions and JS Link in classic experience
- Work with NoScript via tenant app catalog
