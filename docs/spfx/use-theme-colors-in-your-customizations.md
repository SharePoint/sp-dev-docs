# Use theme colors in your SharePoint Framework customizations

When building SharePoint Framework customizations, you should use theme colors so that your customizations look like a part of the site. This article explains how can you refer to the theme colors of the context site in your SharePoint Framework solution.

> [!NOTE]
> Although this article uses a SharePoint Framework client-side web part as an example, the described techniques apply to all types of SharePoint Framework customizations.

## Fixed colors vs. theme colors

When you scaffold a new SharePoint Framework client-side web part, it uses a fixed blue palette. When you add such a web part on a modern site by using a different color scheme, it stands out and doesn't look like a part of the site.

![SharePoint Framework client-side web part using the blue color scheme on a modern team site using the red theme](../images/themed-styles-blue-web-part-red-site.png)

When using fixed colors, you decide upfront which colors you want to use for which elements. This can lead to a situation like the one just illustrated, where a blue web part is displayed on a red team site, standing out unnecessarily. In most cases, you should strive to leverage the theme colors of the context site so that your solution doesn't stand out but looks like a part of the site.

Instead of using fixed colors, SharePoint Framework allows you to refer to the theme colors of the context site. As a result, if your web part is placed on a site that uses a red theme, it uses the red palette as well, and if it's placed on a site that uses the blue theme, it automatically adjusts itself to use the blue palette. All of this is done automatically without any changes to the web part code in between.

## Use theme colors in the SharePoint Framework

When working with fixed colors, you specify them in CSS properties, for example:

```css
.button {
  background-color: #0078d7;
}
```

To use a theme color instead, replace the fixed color with a theme token:

```css
.button {
  background-color: "[theme: themePrimary, default: #0078d7]";
}
```

When your SharePoint Framework customization is loading on the page, the **\@microsoft/load-themed-styles** package, which is a part of the SharePoint Framework, looks for theme tokens in CSS files and tries to replace them with the corresponding color from the current theme. If the value for the specified token is not available, SharePoint Framework uses the value specified by using the **default** parameter instead, which is why it's important that you always include it.

## Use theme colors in your customizations

When you scaffold a new SharePoint Framework client-side web part, by default, it uses the fixed blue palette. The following steps describe the necessary adjustments to have the web part use theme colors instead.

> [!NOTE]
> The following steps apply to a SharePoint Framework client-side web part named _HelloWorld_ built by using React. For web parts built using different libraries and other types of customizations, you might need to adjust the modifications accordingly.

### To use theme colors

1. In the code editor, open the **./src/webparts/helloWorld/components/HelloWorld.tsx** file, and from the div with class **ms-Grid-row**, remove the **ms-bgColor-themeDark** class.

    ![The 'ms-bgColor-themeDark' class selected in Visual Studio Code editor](../images/themed-styles-ms-bgcolor-themedark-class.png)

1. In the same folder, open the **HelloWorld.module.scss** file. Change the `.row` selector to:

    ```css
    .row {
      padding: 20px;
      background-color: "[theme: themeDark, default: #005a9e]";
    }
    ```

    ![The .row selector extended with background color](../images/themed-styles-row-class.png)

1. In the `.button` selector, change the `background-color` and `border-color` properties to:

    ```css
    .button {
      /* ... */
      background-color: "[theme: themePrimary, default: #0078d7]";
      border-color: "[theme: themePrimary, default: #0078d7]";
      /* ... */
    }
    ```

    ![The .button selector updated with references to theme colors](../images/themed-styles-button-class.png)

1. When you add the web part to a site, the colors used by the web part automatically adapt to the theme colors used by the current site.

    ![Side-by-side view of the same web part displayed in two sites using different colors. The web part follows the color scheme of each website](../images/themed-styles-side-by-side.png)

### Support section backgrounds

A customization utilizing theme colors may still stand out if it doesn't respond to section background changes via theme variants support. See [Supporting Section Backgrounds](./web-parts/guidance/supporting-section-backgrounds.md) for more information.

A web part without theme variants support uses a white background regardless of the selected section background color.

![customization without theme variant support](../images/customization-without-theme-variants-support.png)

A web part configured to support theme variants can apply the section background to the web part background.

## Available theme tokens and their occurrences

In the context of modern SharePoint sites, the values associated with theme tokens have numerous occurrences within front-end, system page, and SharePoint web part UI. To best match your customizations to the general look and feel, consideration should be made to using appropriate theme tokens.

The following theme tokens are available for you to use:

> [!NOTE]
> Default values below correspond to the defaults on a modern team site when using the **red palette**.

| Token                  | Default                  | Remarks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Occurrence of theme tokens within SharePoint UI may differ depending upon selected background colors (i.e., theme token, `white` is used for header navigation links if a dark header background is selected, otherwise `neutralSecondary` is used). See [Designing for section backgrounds using semantic slots](../design/semantic_slots.md) for more information.

> [!NOTE]
> There are more tokens registered with the SharePoint Framework, although only the subset mentioned above are assignable in custom themes on modern SharePoint sites (the rest being generated automatically by the theming engine). For the complete list of available tokens, see the value of the `window.__themeState__.theme` property by using the console in your web browser's developer tools.

### Customizing theme colors

In order to customize theme colors, a custom theme should be created and added to a SharePoint tenant for selection on a target site or hub. See [SharePoint site theming](/sharepoint/dev/declarative-customization/site-theming/sharepoint-site-theming-overview) for more information.
