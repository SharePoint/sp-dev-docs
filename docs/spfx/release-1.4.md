**Released:** December 7, 2017

## Upgrading projects from v1.3 to v1.4

    1. Uninstall the existing v1.3 package:

        ```console
        npm uninstall @microsoft/{spfx-package-name}@1.3
        ```

    1. Install the refreshed v1.4 package:

        ```console
        npm install @microsoft/{spfx-package-name}@1.4.0 --save --save-exact
        ```

- Introduce the ability to specify a relative path to an icon in a web part or extension manifest

### @microsoft/generator-sharepoint

- Add missing tilde to libraries when generating client-side extension projects
- Enable **skipLibCheck** to work around the inconsistent declarations of "WeakMap" in lodash and es2015.collection

### @microsoft/sp-http

- Promote **SPHttpClientBatch** from @alpha to @beta
- Initial beta release of **SPHttpHeader** enum and `SPHttpClientResponse.correlationId` property

### @microsoft/sp-loader

- Disallow loading of components built using SPFx preview releases prior to 1.0

- Enable the `preloadComponents` field to be used with other client-side component manifest types 

### @microsoft/sp-webpart-base

- Add `shouldNotPersist` to `IWebPartPropertyMetadata` to allow marking web part properties that shouldn't persist on the server

### @microsoft/sp-lodash-subset

- Add `escaperegex()` function
- Use **lodash-cli** to significantly reduce the bundle size for **\@microsoft/sp-lodash-subset**
- Add `find()` function

## Changes in this release

- Remove outdated JSON schema settings
- Fix an issue with parsing on-premises configuration files
- Fix an issue where we appended "WebPart" to the class name twice when creating a web part with no template

- Remove @beta designation for `WebPartContext`

## Deprecations and removed items in this release
