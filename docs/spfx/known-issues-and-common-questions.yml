          Dev certificate issue with Chrome (v58-)
        answer: |
          - *Date - April 28, 2017*
          - *Updated - May 2, 2017*
          
          If you are using Chrome as your development browser, you might have challenges with the developer certificate regardless of executing the `gulp trust-dev-cert` command. Chrome has changed its model for certificate validation starting from version 58, and you might see a "Your connection is not private" warning when you are accessing the local workbench.
          
          You should update your Yeoman template packages. We have updated certification creation logic in the [*\@microsoft/gulp-core-build-serve* package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/gulp-core-build-serve).
          
          In existing solutions, you can simply delete this folder and run `npm install` to get the updated package. You also need to execute `untrust-dev-cert` and `trust-dev-cert` commands on your machine to address the certification creation logic issue.
