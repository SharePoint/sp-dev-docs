## New features and capabilities

### Adaptive Card Extensions card view caching

For improved performance, SharePoint Framework now supports local caching of your Adaptive Card Extension's card views. The cached card view will be immediately rendered when loading your Adaptive Card Extension. After Adaptive Card Extension loads, it can optionally update the card view.

```typescript
interface ICacheSettings {
/**
 * Whether cache is enabled. Default: true
 */
isEnabled: boolean;
/**
 * Expiry time in seconds. Default: 86400 seconds (24 hours)
 */
expiryTimeInSeconds: number;

/**
 * Returns the Card View used to generate the cached card.
 * By default, the currently rendered Card View will be used to cache the card.
 */
cachedCardView?: () => BaseCardView;
}
BaseAdaptiveCardExtension.getCacheSettings(): Partial<ICacheSettings>;
```

By default caching is enabled with default settings. An Adaptive Card Extension can customize its
cache settings by overriding `getCacheSettings` to return the settings it wants to override.

When the last known card view shouldn't be cached, you can provide a specific card view to be
cached and displayed on the next page load through `ICacheSettings.cachedCardView`. This card view
doesn't need to have been previously registered.

An Adaptive Card Extension can also locally cache its current state. By default no state is cached.

```typescript
BaseAdaptiveCardExtension.getCachedState(state: TState): Partial<TState>;
```

If `getCachedState` is overridden, then the cached values will be provided when the Adaptive Card
Extension is initialized on the next page load.

`onInit` has a new overload, which passes information about the cached card state. If the card wasn't
loaded from a cached card view, then `cachedLoadParameters` will be `undefined`.

```typescript
interface ICachedLoadParameters {
    state: TState;
}
BaseAdaptiveCardExtension.onInit(cachedLoadParameters?: ICachedLoadParameters): Promise<void>;
```

Initial state of the Adaptive Card Extension can be seeded from the cached state. The cached state can also be used to determine if any further logic needs to be executed.

State caching and the cache expiry time can be used to determine when
expensive remote calls need to be made by the Adaptive Card Extension.

Caching can help significantly improve the perceived performance for your Adaptive Card Extension.

### Web Part lifecycle method for theme changes

```typescript
BaseClientSideWebPart.onThemeChanged(theme: IReadonlyTheme | undefined): void;
```

When a theme is initialized or changed on a page, `onThemeChanged` will be invoked with the new theme.

> [!NOTE]
> `render` should not be invoked in `onThemeChanged`. Calling `render` can lead to unpredicted re-flow of the web part. `render` will automatically be invoked if needed.

### Detect if a component is loading from localhost

```typescript
BaseComponentContext.isServedFromLocalhost(): boolean;
```

Any SPFx component can now check if it's currently running from code served locally.

### Hide a Property Pane group name

```typescript
IPropertyPaneGroup.isGroupNameHidden?: boolean;
```

`isGroupNameHidden` can be used to skip the rendering of the Property Pane group name to avoid an empty group header being displayed.

The default value of `isGroupNameHidden` is false.

### Updated Web Part Templates

- No Framework, and React templates are updated with new end-user friendly UI for SharePoint and Microsoft Teams with theme detection, section background color support and more.
- New "Minimal" template is added: allows to start development with the minimal amount of code provisioned.

### Get Current ViewNavigator for Adaptive Card Extension

```typescript
BaseAdaptiveCardExtension.navigator
```

If the current `renderType` is `Card` then returns `BaseAdaptiveCardExtension.cardNavigator`. If the current `renderType` is `QuickView` then returns `BaseAdaptiveCardExtension.quickViewNavigator`.

#### Error Handler Method. This method will be invoked when an Action throws an error.

```typescript
BaseView.onActionError(error: IActionErrorArguments): void
```

Override this method to handle errors from Adaptive Card actions.

### New Action types for media and geolocation.

> [!NOTE]
> These new actions are **only available in the browser** currently. Viva Connections desktop and Viva Connections mobile support will be enabled later.

After General Availability the support matrix for actions will look like:

Action       | Viva Connection Desktop | Viva Connections Mobile | Browser
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
Select Media  | Supported   | Supported | Supported
Get Location  | Not Supported | Supported | Supported
Show Location | Not Supported | Supported | Supported

```typescript
ISPFxAdaptiveCard.actions?: (
    | ISubmitAction
    | IOpenUrlAction
    | IShowCardAction
    | ISelectMediaAction // Raise a file picker or native media picker
    | IGetLocationAction // Get a location
    | IShowLocationAction // Show a location on a map
)[];
```

The SelectMedia and Location action can be configured as shown below:

```typescript
  actions: [
    {
      type: 'VivaAction.SelectMedia',
      id: 'Select File',
      parameters: {mediaType: MediaType.Image, allowMultipleCapture: true, maxSizePerFile : 200000, supportedFileFormats: ['jpg']},
      title: 'Select File'
    },
    {
      type: 'VivaAction.GetLocation',
      id: 'Get Location',
      parameters: {chooseLocationOnMap: true}
    },
    {
      type: 'VivaAction.ShowLocation',
      id: 'Show Location',
      parameters: parameters: {locationCoordinates: {latitude: 40, longitude: 40}}
    }
  ]
```

### List View Command Set Updates

> [NOTE!]
> Although the APIs are added, the functionality may not be available on some tenants.

#### Inform ListView on Command Set Changes

```typescript
BaseListViewCommandSet.raiseOnChange: () => void
```

Use this method to fire `onChange` event and initialize a reflow of the ListView.

#### Expanded List View Accessor State

`ListViewAccessor` provides expanded state of the current list view. **New** state properties are listed below.

- `rows` - currently rendered rows in the list view.
- `selectedRows` - selected rows in the list view.
- `list` - basic information about the list rendered by the list view.
- `view` - basic information about the view rendered by the list view.
- `folderInfo` - folder information for the list view.
- `appliedFilters` - filters applied to the list view.
- `sortField` - sort field name.
- `sortAscending` - specifies whether the list view is sorted ascending or descending.

#### List View State Changed Event

```typescript
ListViewAccessor.listViewStateChangedEvent: SPEvent<ListViewStateChangedEventArgs>
```

This event gets raised every time the list view state changes. The arguments contain type of occurred event (see `ListViewAccessorStateChanges`) and previous state of the list view (see `IListViewAccessorState`).

### Predefined Web Part Picker Group for Web Parts in Development

```typescript
PredefinedGroup.Local = '8b7bf6f1-a56a-4aa3-8657-7eb6e7e6af61';
```

The group displays locally debugged web parts.

### Call back to Clear DOM Element Before Loading Indicator or Error Element is Displayed

```typescript
IClientSideWebPartStatusRenderer.displayLoadingIndicator(domElement: Element, loadingMessage: string, timeout?: number, clearDomElementCallback?: ClearDomElementCallback): void;
IClientSideWebPartStatusRenderer.renderError(domElement: HTMLElement, error: Error | string, clearDomElementCallback?: ClearDomElementCallback);
```

Use `clearDomElementCallback` to clear the DOM node.

### ipAddress Property in serve.json

New property `ipAddress` has been added to `serve.json` configuration. This parameter is helpful when using Docker containers. For example, to set the serve host as '0.0.0.0'.
This property will be explicitly used to wind up the server, meaning all debug URLs and webpack configurations won't be affected.

### Image Helper API

The **ImageHelper** static class (in @microsoft/sp-image-helper) has been added to allow SPFx developers runtime access to:

- Urls of auto-generated thumbnail images of pages and documents stored in SharePoint
- More optimized Urls to images stored in SharePoint

Learn more: [Image Helper API](image-helper-api.md)

### Changes to Scaffolding Options and Prompts

- New prompt for solution description is added.
- "Tenant-wide deployment" prompt is removed. The property is set to `true` by default and can be changed manually or using `skip-feature-deployment` argument.
- The next prompts were deprecated in favor to their defaults:
  - Solution description
  - Environment (SharePoint) version
  - Tenant-wide deployment
  - Isolated permissions
  - Component description
