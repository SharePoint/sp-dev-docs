# SharePoint Framework support on SharePoint Online

SharePoint Online always has the broadest and most up-to-date support for the SharePoint Framework (SPFx). The SharePoint Framework is also the recommended customization and extensibility development model for SharePoint Online.

All published versions of SFPx, as well as the latest betas, are published and available on SharePoint Online. This means that regardless of the version you use to build custom SPFx components, they'll always work on SharePoint Online sites.

Each SPFx component's manifest tells the SPFx runtime on SharePoint pages what package dependencies, including the specific versions, each component depends on. The SPFx runtime uses this information to ensure the correct SPFx libraries are loaded on the page prior to loading initializing your SPFx components.

Unless otherwise stated, all capabilities of SPFx are supported in SharePoint Online.
