# Create Outlook add-ins using SharePoint Framework

Introduced SharePoint Framework v1.10, you can implement an Outlook Web App add-ins with the SharePoint Framework and use SharePoint as a host for your solution.

Using the SharePoint Framework as the platform for your Outlook Web App add-ins include the following benefits:

- The development model is similar to SharePoint Framework web parts.
- Same code can work across SharePoint, Teams, and Office.
- Your add-in is automatically hosted for the tenant without any additional services.
- Simplified authentication to access different services in Microsoft 365.
- You can benefit from the same permission and access management model as within SharePoint with easy access to Microsoft Graph APIs and other services.

[!INCLUDE [developer-preview-notice](../../includes/snippets/developer-preview-notice.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> During developer preview, this feature is only supported in Outlook Web Access. Once it this feature reaches generally availability, it will be supported across all Office desktop and web clients.

## Development process

You can start developing Outlook add-ins simply by using the SharePoint Framework v1.10 or later packages. To use this feature in developer preview, you'll need to include the `--plusbeta` argument when executing the Yeoman generator:

```console
yo @microsoft/sharepoint --plusbeta
```

This will automatically generate Office Add-in manifest file for the solution with default settings to **officeAddin** folder created to the project. This file is automatically generated with default settings, which enable your web part to be used in the Outlook Web App as a Task pane extension.

You'll need to deploy the solution to tenant using the **tenant scoped deployment option** to ensure that the component can be found in the context of the add-in URL as defined in the manifest xml file. This setting can be adjusted in the **package-solution.json** file by updating the `skipFeatureDeployment` as `true`.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on the manifest file, see: [Office Add-ins: Office Add-ins XML manifest](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/develop/add-in-manifests).

## Use Office JavaScript SDK (Office.js) in the web part code

Before you can use the Office JavaScript SDK in your code, you'll need to include correct types for the solution. You can install latest types by adding **@types/office-js** package from the npm to your solution with following command:

```console
npm install @types/office-js --save-dev
```

You can detect if the web part is on the Office context by using page context as shown on the following property, which refers to the Office JavaScript SDK. This property value is dependent on the context where the code is being executed.

```javascript
this.context.sdks.office
```

For example, you can access the inbox using following property:

```javascript
this.context.sdks.office.context.mailbox
```

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on the Office JavaScript API capabilities, see: [Office Add-ins: API Reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/reference/javascript-api-for-office).

## Configuration support with Office Add-ins

Office Add-ins build with SharePoint Framework support one time configuration option when the add-in is initially viewed. This is an optional capability, which can be controlled from the add-in manifest file. Configuration option is controlled in the URL of the solution at the manifest file. By default the configuration option is enabled and the URL is as follows:

```http
https://{tenant}.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/outlookhostedapp.aspx
  ?componentId=c76ba09e-4068-4233-b342-aedfc75a6578&amp;isConfigureMode=true
```

If your add-in doesn't have any initial configuration options, you can remove the **isConfigureMode** query parameter and update the URL. In the example case, that would mean adjusting the URL as follows:

```http
https://{tenant}.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/outlookhostedapp.aspx
  ?componentId=c76ba09e-4068-4233-b342-aedfc75a6578
```

Notice that the **componentId** query parameter is solution-specific setting, which shouldn't be copied from the documentation as such.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Configuration option is only available during initial view of the add-in. It is not supported to re-configure add-in after the initial configuration. This is currently by design as there's no similar configuration capability for the normal Office add-ins. If there's a demand for this capability, please do let us know using the UserVoice.

## Deployment of your add-in

Deployment is a two-step process for the Outlook Web App add-ins:

1. Deploy solution to SharePoint App Catalog
1. Use side loading to activate the add-in in Outlook Web App

You can deploy your solution to Outlook Web App by using so called side-loading technique by following below steps:

1. Move to the Outlook web client using your browser.
1. Activate one of the existing mails in your inbox.
1. Select **[...]** and choose **Get Add-ins**:

   ![Get add-ins context menu](../images/add-in-get-add-ins-context-menu.png)

1. Select **My add-ins** from the left menu:

    ![My add-ins left menu](../images/add-in-my-addins-menu.png)

1. Select **Add from file...** under the **Custom add-ins**:

    ![Add from file](../images/add-in-add-from-file.png)

1. Upload the manifest xml file from your project solution under the **officeAddin** folder.
1. Select **Install** on the warning message to get your add-in available on the tenant

    ![Warning - Install](../images/add-in-install-warning.png)

1. Close the add-in window by selecting **X** in the top-right corner
1. Activate again the context menu from ***[...]*** and select **SPFx template** to activate the add-in in your inbox
   1. Name can be adjusted in the manifest file as needed

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deployment process will include different steps when additional applications and desktop will be supported.
