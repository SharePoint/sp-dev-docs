## New features and capabilities

### Node.js v22 support

Node.js support has been updated to version 22 with the 1.21 release.

> [!NOTE]
> Notice that Node.js version 22 is the only supported version with version 1.21.

### TypeScript 5.x support

TypeScript has been updated to TypeScript 5.x. Default scaffolded projects are using currently specifically 5.3.3 version by default.

### Flexible layout configuration options for web parts

New flexible layout sizing options are introduced for the web part manifest. These can be used to adjust the default behavior for the custom web parts as they're used within flexible layouts.

```json
  "flexibleLayoutSizing": {
    "supportsDynamicResizing": true,
    "defaultRowHeight": 10,
    "defaultColumnWidth": 10
  }
```

> [!NOTE]
> By default, all custom web parts are supported in the flexible layout option and don't require any code level changes.

### Viva Connections card personalization support

Viva Connections will start supporting end user configuration options for the dashboard. End users can add and remove cards from the dashboard based on their preference. Supported cards are explicitly enabled for this scenario and custom cards are supported.

By default, personalization isn't allowed for the custom Viva Connections cards.

```json
  "personalization": [
    "Disallow"
  ]
```
