# SharePoint Framework v1.21 release notes

This release has initial configuration updates for web parts in the context of flexible layouts in SharePoint and personalization option for cards. We're also looking to further include other technical updates before this version is generally available.

[!INCLUDE [spfx-release-beta](../../includes/snippets/spfx-release-beta.md)]

beta.0 **Released:** February 25, 2025

[!INCLUDE [spfx-release-notes-common](../../includes/snippets/spfx-release-notes-common.md)]

## Install the latest version

Install the latest generally available release of the SharePoint Framework (SPFx) by using the **@next** tag

```console
npm install @microsoft/generator-sharepoint@next --global
```

## Upgrading projects from the SPFx v1.20 to v1.21 preview version

In the project's **package.json** file, identify all SPFx v1.20 packages. For each SPFx package:

1. Uninstall the existing v1.20 package:

    ```console
    npm uninstall @microsoft/{spfx-package-name}@1.20
    ```

1. Install the new v1.21 preview package:

    ```console
    npm install @microsoft/{spfx-package-name}@next --save --save-exact
    ```

## New features and capabilities

### Flexible layout configuration options for web parts

New flexible layout sizing options are introduced for the web part manifest. These can be used to adjust the default behavior for the custom web parts as they're used within flexible layouts.

```json
  "flexibleLayoutSizing": {
    "supportsDynamicResizing": true,
    "defaultRowHeight": 10,
    "defaultColumnWidth": 10
  }
```

> [!NOTE]
> By default all custom web parts are supported in the flexible layout option and don't require any code level changes.

### Viva Connections card personalization support

Viva Connections will start supporting end user configuration options for the dashboard. End users can add and remove cards from the dashboard based on their preference. Supported cards are explicitly enabled for this scenario and also custom cards are supported.

By default personalization isn't allowed for the custom Viva Connections cards.

```json
  "personalization": [
    "Disallow"
  ]
```
