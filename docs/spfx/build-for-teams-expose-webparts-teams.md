# Expose SharePoint Framework web parts in Microsoft Teams

Using SharePoint Framework, you can build [web parts](web-parts/overview-client-side-web-parts.md) and [extensions](extensions/overview-extensions.md). When building web parts, you can enable them to be exposed as a [Microsoft Teams tab](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/what-are-tabs), a [personal app](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/design/personal-apps) or a [messaging extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions).

> [!TIP]
> To see how to use the different concepts described in this article, see the sample [Leads application](https://github.com/pnp/sp-dev-solutions/tree/master/solutions/LeadsLOBSolution) on GitHub.

## Expose web part as Microsoft Teams tab

To expose a SharePoint Framework client-side web part as a Microsoft Teams tab, in the web partâ€™s manifest, in the `supportedHosts` property, add `TeamsTab`.

## Expose web part as Microsoft Teams personal app

To expose the web part as a Microsoft Teams personal app, in the web partâ€™s manifest, in the `supportedHosts` property, add `TeamsPersonalApp`.

![TeamsPersonalApp host added to the supportedHosts property in a web part manifest](../images/build-for-teams/build-for-teams-manifest-teamspersonalapp.png)

> [!TIP]
> The same SharePoint Framework web part can be exposed as a web part in SharePoint, Microsoft Teams tab and a personal Teams app. The values specified in the `supportedHosts` property decide how users will be able to work with your web part.

## Expose web part as Microsoft Teams messaging extension

To expose your SharePoint Framework web part as a messaging extension, you don't need to use a specific host in the `supportedHosts` property. Instead, all you need to do, is to extend the teams manifest in your SharePoint Framework solution with a `composeExtension`, for example:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/teams/v1.5/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json",
  "manifestVersion": "1.5",
  // trimmed for brevity
  "composeExtensions": [
    {
      "botId": "a349bab7-f895-4d6e-977a-764779833699",
      "canUpdateConfiguration": true,
      "commands": [
        {
          "id": "shareLead",
          "type": "action",
          "title": "Share a lead",
          "description": "Find and share a lead",
          "initialRun": false,
          "fetchTask": false,
          "context": [
            "commandBox",
            "compose"
          ],
          "taskInfo": {
            "title": "Share a lead",
            "width": "1100",
            "height": "665",
            "url": "https://{teamSiteDomain}/_layouts/15/TeamsLogon.aspx?SPFX=true&dest=/_layouts/15/teamstaskhostedapp.aspx%3Fteams%26personal%26componentId=e81a1b68-686e-412f-90ac-cb80f2544398%26forceLocale={locale}"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  // trimmed for brevity
}
```

The key piece of information is the URL in the `taskInfo` property, which must match the URL specified in the example and which should have the `componentId` query string parameter set to the ID of the SharePoint Framework web part that should be exposed in the messaging extension.

### Responding to user interaction

When your web part is exposed in Microsoft Teams as a messaging extension, you might want to respond to user interaction, for example by posting an adaptive card to the conversation. This requires using a [task module](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/what-are-task-modules) and a [bot](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/bots/what-are-bots). The task module notifies the bot of the event that the user triggered, and the bot will post data back to the conversation. First however, you need to check if the web part is used as a messaging extension.

To check if your web part is being used as a messaging extension, check if the `context._host._teamsManager._appContext.applicationName` property is set to `TeamsTaskModuleApplication`:

```typescript
private leadClicked = (ev?: React.SyntheticEvent<HTMLElement>): void => {
  const host: string = this.props.host._teamsManager._appContext.applicationName;
  if (host !== 'TeamsTaskModuleApplication') {
    return;
  }

  // web part used as a messaging extension
}
```

[see full code](https://github.com/pnp/sp-dev-solutions/blob/cd3757ac071e2fb9f90a3f64b43ede8b1de39a0c/solutions/LeadsLOBSolution/webpart/src/webparts/leads/components/Leads/Leads.tsx#L111-L114)

Once you verified that the web part is used as a messaging extension, you use a task module, to pass the data from the web part to the bot:

```typescript
private leadClicked = (ev?: React.SyntheticEvent<HTMLElement>): void => {
  const host: string = this.props.host._teamsManager._appContext.applicationName;
  if (host !== 'TeamsTaskModuleApplication') {
    return;
  }

  // web part used as a messaging extension
  this.props.teamsContext.tasks.submitTask(selectedLead[0]);
}
```

[see full code](https://github.com/pnp/sp-dev-solutions/blob/cd3757ac071e2fb9f90a3f64b43ede8b1de39a0c/solutions/LeadsLOBSolution/webpart/src/webparts/leads/components/Leads/Leads.tsx#L128)

After receiving the notification, the bot can process the retrieved data and post some information to the conversation.

```typescript
protected async handleTeamsMessagingExtensionSubmitAction(context: TurnContext, action: MessagingExtensionAction): Promise<MessagingExtensionActionResponse> {
  const lead: Lead = action.data;
  let leadChangeIcon: string = "";
  if (lead.change > 0) {
    leadChangeIcon = "ðŸ”¼ ";
  } else if (lead.change < 0) {
    leadChangeIcon = "ðŸ”½ ";
  }

  const leadCard = CardFactory.adaptiveCard({
    "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
    "type": "AdaptiveCard",
    "version": "1.0",
    // trimmed for brevity
  });

  await context.sendActivity({ attachments: [leadCard] });

  return Promise.resolve({});
}
```

> [!TIP]
> For more information about building Microsoft Teams messaging extensions see the [Microsoft Teams documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions). To see an example of how a SharePoint Framework web part is exposed as a messaging extension see the sample [Leads application](https://github.com/pnp/sp-dev-solutions/tree/master/solutions/LeadsLOBSolution) on GitHub.

When you choose to expose your SharePoint Framework web parts in Microsoft Teams, you have a number of options for how to deploy them to Microsoft Teams.

## Use the autogenerated Microsoft Teams manifest

By default, the SharePoint Framework build toolchain automatically generates a Teams application manifest for you. This manifest includes all web parts that you have configured to be exposed in Microsoft Teams either as tabs or personal apps.

![Microsoft Teams manifest automatically generated by the SharePoint Framework build toolchain](../images/build-for-teams/build-for-teams-manifest-teamsmanifest.png)

When you package your SharePoint Framework solution, this manifest is embedded in the generated solution package (.sppkg). After deploying the solution package to the SharePoint app catalog, choose the **Sync to Teams** option to make your tabs visible in Microsoft Teams.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Sync to Teams** option will be enabled only for SharePoint Framework solution packages that have one or more web parts that can be exposed as Microsoft Teams tabs or personal apps.

After syncing your solution to Teams, users can add tabs to channels.

If you exposed some of your web parts as personal Teams app, users can install them as well:

## Create your own Microsoft Teams manifest

For advanced scenarios you can use the Teams manifest scaffolded with your SharePoint Framework project as a starting point and extend it to your needs. You might need to do this if you want to use different title or description for your web part and Teams tab, if you want to have separate Teams applications for the different web parts, combine multiple web parts in a single personal app or control the deployment process.

In this case, in your SharePoint Framework solutionâ€™s teams folder, edit the contents of the **manifest.json** file as necessary, and package the manifest and both icons in a .zip file.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you package the whole folder rather than just its contents, deploying the package to Microsoft Teams will fail.
