# Deploy your SharePoint client-side web part to a CDN

>**Note:** The SharePoint Framework is currently in Preview, and is subject to change based on customer feedback.  While weâ€™re in preview, SharePoint Framework web parts are not supported for use in production environments.

## Tutorial 4 Overview
In this tutorial, we will deploy the `HelloWorld` assets to a remote CDN instead of using the local environment. We will use an Azure Storage account integrated with CDN to deploy our assets. SharePoint Framework build tools provide out of the box support for deploying to Azure Storage account. However, you can manually upload the files to your favourite CDN provider or SharePoint as well. 

## Tutorial pre-requisites
As a pre-requisite, you should have completed the following tutorials before you start this tutorial:
* [Tutorial 1 - HelloWorld Web Part](./HelloWorld-WebPart)
* [Tutorial 2 - HelloWorld, Talking to SharePoint](./HelloWorld,-Talking-to-SharePoint) 
* [Tutorial 3 - HelloWorld, Serving in Classic SharePoint Page](./HelloWorld,-Serving-in-SharePoint-Page)

Each step below will build on the previous so you will need to go through each step one by one to successfully complete this lab.

## Step 1: Configure Azure Storage account 
For this tutorial, you will need to first configure an Azure Storage account and integrate with CDN.

You can follow the instructions [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/cdn-create-a-storage-account-with-cdn/) on how to create a Storage account and integrate with CDN.

Once you have successfully setup the Storage account, you will need the following information to complete this tutorials:
* Storage account name
* BLOB Container name
* Storage account access key

## Step 2: Project directory
Switch to console and make sure you are still in the project directory used in Tutorial 1, 2 and 3. 

If you still have `gulp serve` running, terminate the task by pressing `Ctrl+C`

Else, navigate to your project directory:

```
cd helloworld-webpart
```

## Step 3: Configure Azure Storage account details
Switch to Visual Studio Code and navigate to `HelloWorld` web part project.

Open `deploy-azure-storage.json` in the `config` folder.

This is the file that contains your Azure Storage account details.

```javascript
{
  "workingDir": "./temp/deploy/",
  "account": "<!-- STORAGE ACCOUNT NAME -->",
  "container": "helloworld-webpart",
  "accessKey": "<!-- ACCESS KEY -->"
}
```
Replace the `account`, `container`, `accessKey` with your storage account name, BLOB container and storage account access key respectively. 

`workingDir` is the directory where the web part assets will be located. 

Save the file.

## Step 4: Prepare web part assets to deploy
Before uploading the assets to CDN, we first need to build them.

Switch to the console and execute the following `gulp` task:

```
gulp --ship
```

This will build the minified assets required to upload to the CDN provider. The `--ship` indicates the build tool to build for distribution. You should also notice the output of the build tools indicate the Build Target is SHIP.

```
Build target: SHIP
[21:23:01] Using gulpfile ~/apps/helloworld-webpart/gulpfile.js
[21:23:01] Starting gulp
[21:23:01] Starting 'default'...
```

The minified assets can be found under the `tmp\deploy` directory.

## Step 5: Deploy assets to Azure Storage
Switch to the console of the `HelloWorld` project directory.

Type the gulp task to deploy the assets to your storage account:

```
gulp deploy-azure-storage
```

This will deploy the web part bundle along with other assets like JavaScript, CSS files etc., to CDN.

### Configuring web part to load from CDN
In order for the web part to load from your CDN, you will need to tell it your CDN path.

Switch to Visual Studio Code and open the `write-manifests.json` from the `config` folder. 

Type your CDN base path for the `cdnBasePath` property. 

```
{
  "cdnBasePath": "<!-- PATH TO CDN -->"
}
```
Save the file.

## Step 6: Deploy the updated package

### Package solution
Since we have changed the web part bundle, we will need to re-deploy the package to the App Catalog. We used `--ship` to generate minified assets for distribution. 

Switch to the console of the `HelloWorld` project directory.

Type the gulp task to package the client-side solution. This time with the `--ship` flag to indiciate to pick uo the CDN base path configured in the previous step:

```
gulp package-solution --ship
```

This will create the updated client-side solution package in the `sharepoint\solution` folder.

### Upload to App Catalog
Upload or drag & drop the client-side solution package to the App Catalog.

Since we already had deployed the package, you will be prompted asking whether to replace the existing package.

![Replace client-side solution package](./images/sp-app-replace-pkg.png)

Click `Replace It`.

App Catalog will now have the latest client-side solution package where the web part bundle is loaded from the CDN.

This will update all the instances of our `HelloWorld` web part in SharePoint to now fetch the resources from CDN.

## Step 7: Test the HelloWorld web part

### Classic SharePoint Page
Navigate to the `HelloWorld` web part page we created in the previous tutorial:

Your `HelloWorld` web part will now load the web part bundle and other assets from CDN.

Notice you are no longer running `gulp serve` and hence nothing served from `localhost`.

## Deploying to other CDNs
In order to deploy the assets to your favorite CDN provider, you can copy the files from`tmp\deploy` folder. To generate assets for distribution you will run the following gulp command as we did before with the `--ship` parameter:

```
gulp --ship
```
