# Add jQueryUI Accordion to your SharePoint client-side web part

>**Note:** The SharePoint Framework is currently in Preview, and is subject to change based on customer feedback.  While weâ€™re in preview, SharePoint Framework web parts are not supported for use in production environments.

## Tutorial 5 Overview

In this tutorial, lets add the jQueryUI Accordion to our web part project. We will build on top of the skills from previous tutorials, but will create a new web part for it. 

The completed web part will look like this: 

![jquery-accordion](./images/jquery-accordion-wb.png)

## Tutorial Pre-requisites
As a pre-requisite, you should have completed the following tutorials before you start this tutorial:
* [Tutorial 1 - HelloWorld Web Part](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-docs/wiki/HelloWorld-WebPart)
* [Tutorial 2 - HelloWorld, Talking to SharePoint](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-docs/wiki/HelloWorld,-Talking-to-SharePoint) 

As explained in the [Tutorial 1](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-docs/wiki/HelloWorld-WebPart#helloworldmanifestjson), the developer toolchain uses Webpack, SystemJS and CommonJS to bundle your web parts. This also includes loading any external dependencies you have such as jQuery, jQueryUI etc., To load such external dependencies, at a high level, you will need to:
* Acquire the external library, either via npm or download from the vendor
* If available, install the respective framework's [TypeScript type definitions](http://definitelytyped.org/)
* If required, update your solution config to not include the external dependency in your web part bundle by default

Lets now go build the jQueryUI Accordion in our web part. 

Each step below will build on the previous so you will need to go through each step one by one to successfully complete this lab.

## Step 1: Project Directory
Create a new project directory in your favorite location:

```
md jquery-webpart
```
    
> **Warning!** Make sure to create this directory in a new folder, not as a subdirectory of `helloworld-webpart`.

Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd jquery-webpart
```
    
## Step 2: Create a new WebPart Project
Create a new jQuery webpart by running the Yeoman SharePoint Generator:

```
yo @microsoft/sharepoint
```

You will be prompted with a series of questions:
* Accept the default `jquery-webpart` as your solution name and press `Enter`.
* Select "Use the current folder" to place the files.

The next set of prompts will ask specific information about your web part:
* Type `jQuery` for the web part name and press `Enter`.
* Enter `jQuery Web Part` as the description of the web part and press `Enter`.
* Accept the default `No javascript web framework` option for the framework and press `Enter` to continue.
* In the next prompt, press `Enter` to continue. We will not select any libraries to add in this tutorial. 

At this point, yeoman will install the required dependencies and scaffold the solution files. This might take a few minutes. Yeoman will scaffold the project to include your `jQueryWebPart` web part as well.

In the console, type the following to open the web part project in Visual Studio Code:

```
code .
```

## Step 3: Install jQuery and jQuery UI NPM Packages
In the console, type the following to install jQuery npm package:

```
npm i --save jquery
```

Now type the following to install jQueryUI npm package:

```
npm i --save jqueryui
```

TypeScript Definition Manager (TSD) allows you to search and install type definitions for your project. Using TSD we can install the type definitions for jQuery and jQuery UI.

As the web part project is primarily a TypeScript project, it is essential the TypeScript compiler is able to understand the respective types. It also helps to provide the intellisense required in the code editor.

To do, first install [TypeScript definition manager](http://definitelytyped.org/tsd/)

Open your console and execute the commands:

```
npm i -g tsd
```

Now install jQuery and jQuery UI type definitions:

```
tsd install jquery jqueryui --save
```

TSD will install the type definitions into the `/typings` folder, where there are few other typings already available which was scaffolded by the Yeoman generator.

Navigate to `/typings/jquery` and `/typings/jqueryui` to find the type definitions for jQuery and jQuery UI respectively.

For drop 1, there is a workaround needed when loading css files (later on in this tutorial we will show you how).  For now, you need to include one other typing

```
tsd install combokeys --save
```

### Unbundle external dependencies from web part bundle
By default any dependencies you add gets bundled into the web part bundle. While this could be true for some cases, it is not ideal. Hence you can choose to unbundle these dependencies from the web part bundle.

In Visual Studio Code, open the file `config\config.json`

This `config.json` contains information about your bundle(s) and any external dependencies included. 

The `entries` region contains the default bundle information which in our case is the jQuery web part bundle. You will see one entry per web part once you add more web parts to your solution. 

```json
"entries": [
  {
    "entry": "./lib/webparts/jQuery/jQueryWebPart.js",
    "manifest": "./src/webparts/jQuery/jQueryWebPart.manifest.json",
    "outputPath": "./dist/j-query.bundle.js",
  }
]
```

The `externals` section contains the libraries information that are not bundled with the default bundle. As you can see, we have a few by default.

```json
  "externals": {
    "@microsoft/sp-client-base": "node_modules/@microsoft/sp-client-base/dist/sp-client-base.js",
    "@microsoft/sp-client-preview": "node_modules/@microsoft/sp-client-preview/dist/sp-client-preview.js",
    "@microsoft/sp-lodash-subset": "node_modules/@microsoft/sp-lodash-subset/dist/sp-lodash-subset.js",
    "office-ui-fabric-react": "node_modules/office-ui-fabric-react/dist/office-ui-fabric-react.js",
    "react": "node_modules/react/dist/react.min.js",
    "react-dom": "node_modules/react-dom/dist/react-dom.min.js",
    "react-dom/server": "node_modules/react-dom/dist/react-dom-server.min.js"
  },
```

In order to exclude `jQuery` and `jQueryUI` from the default bundle, we add the modules respectively to the `externals` section:

```json
"jquery":"node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js",
"jqueryui":"node_modules/jqueryui/jquery-ui.min.js"
```
Now when you build your project, `jQuery` and `jQueryUI` will not be bundled into your default web part bundle

## Step 4: Build the Accordion
Now that we have defined our external dependencies, it is time we build the accordion.

Switch to Visual Studio Code. Your project should have the `jQuery` web part that we added in the steps above under the `/src/webparts/jQuery` folder.

If you do not have the project open, open the project folder `jquery-webpart` in Visual Studio Code.

### Add Accordion HTML
Add a new file under the `/src/webparts/jQuery` folder called `MyAccordionTemplate.ts`

Create and export (as a module) a class `MyAccordionTemplate` that holds the HTML code for the accordion.

```ts
export default class MyAccordionTemplate {
    public static templateHtml: string =  `
      <div class="accordion">
        <h3>Section 1</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
            Mauris mauris ante, blandit et, ultrices a, suscipit eget, quam. Integer
            ut neque. Vivamus nisi metus, molestie vel, gravida in, condimentum sit
            amet, nunc. Nam a nibh. Donec suscipit eros. Nam mi. Proin viverra leo ut
            odio. Curabitur malesuada. Vestibulum a velit eu ante scelerisque vulputate.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Section 2</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
            Sed non urna. Donec et ante. Phasellus eu ligula. Vestibulum sit amet
            purus. Vivamus hendrerit, dolor at aliquet laoreet, mauris turpis porttitor
            velit, faucibus interdum tellus libero ac justo. Vivamus non quam. In
            suscipit faucibus urna.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Section 3</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
            Nam enim risus, molestie et, porta ac, aliquam ac, risus. Quisque lobortis.
            Phasellus pellentesque purus in massa. Aenean in pede. Phasellus ac libero
            ac tellus pellentesque semper. Sed ac felis. Sed commodo, magna quis
            lacinia ornare, quam ante aliquam nisi, eu iaculis leo purus venenatis dui.
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>List item one</li>
            <li>List item two</li>
            <li>List item three</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Section 4</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
            Cras dictum. Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus
            et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Vestibulum ante ipsum primis in
            faucibus orci luctus et ultrices posuere cubilia Curae; Aenean lacinia
            mauris vel est.
            </p>
            <p>
            Suspendisse eu nisl. Nullam ut libero. Integer dignissim consequat lectus.
            Class aptent taciti sociosqu ad litora torquent per conubia nostra, per
            inceptos himenaeos.
            </p>
        </div>
     </div>`;
}
```

Save the file.

### Import Accordion HTML

As we have declared our accordion HTML in a TypeScript class module, it is also necessary to import that module:

Switch to Visual Studio code and open `src\webparts\jQuery\JQueryWebPart.ts`

At the top of the file, where you can find other imports, add the following import:

```ts
import MyAccordionTemplate from './MyAccordionTemplate';
```

### Import jQuery and jQueryUI
As we have already have jQuery installed as npm modules, we can directly import them in our web part just like we imported MyAccordionTemplate.

At the top of the file, where you can find other imports, add the following import:

```
import * as myjQuery from 'jquery';
```

Notice how we are importing the jQuery module into a custom variable name `myjQuery`. You can call it whatever you want to assign the jQuery module into. Preferably something that is related to your web part is always recommended. 

As jQuery UI is a plugin, we will load it via a require statement instead of import:

Just below the jQuery import, add the following require:

```ts
require('jqueryui');
```

Next, we'll be loading some external css files.  To do that we need to use the module loader.  Add the following import

```ts
import importableModuleLoader from '@microsoft/sp-module-loader';
```

To load the jQuery UI styles, in the `JQueryWebPart` web part class, add the following line inside the constructor:

```ts
importableModuleLoader.loadCss('//code.jquery.com/ui/1.11.4/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css');
```

The constructor should look like this now:

```ts
public constructor(context: IWebPartContext){
    super(context);
    
    importableModuleLoader.loadCss('//code.jquery.com/ui/1.11.4/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css');
}
```

The code above:
* Calls the parent constructor with the context to initialize the webpart
* Loads the accordion styles from a CDN asynchronously

### Render Accordion
In the `jQueryWebPart.ts`, navigate to the `render` method.

Set the web part's inner HTML to render the accordion HTML:

```ts
this.domElement.innerHTML = MyAccordionTemplate.templateHtml;
```

jQueryUI Accordion has few options that you can set to customize the accordion. Lets define few options for our accordion just below `this.domElement.innerHTML = MyAccordionTemplate.templateHtml;`:

```ts
const accordionOptions: JQueryUI.AccordionOptions = {
  animate: true,
  collapsible: false,
  icons: {
    header: 'ui-icon-circle-arrow-e',
    activeHeader: 'ui-icon-circle-arrow-s'
  }
};
```

As you can see jQueryUI typed definition allows us to create a typed variable called `JQueryUI.AccordionOptions` and specify the supported properties. 

Play around with the intellisense and you will notice you will get full support for available methods under `JQueryUI.` as well as the method parameters.

Finally, initialize the accordion:

```ts
myjQuery(this.domElement).children('.accordion').accordion(accordionOptions);
```

As you can see, we use the variable `myjQuery` we used to import `jquery` module earlier. We then initialize the accordion.

Here is the complete `render` method class looks like after changes above:

```ts
public render(): void {
  this.domElement.innerHTML = MyAccordionTemplate.templateHtml;

  const accordionOptions: JQueryUI.AccordionOptions = {
    animate: true,
    collapsible: false,
    icons: {
      header: 'ui-icon-circle-arrow-e',
      activeHeader: 'ui-icon-circle-arrow-s'
    }
  };

  myjQuery(this.domElement).children('.accordion').accordion(accordionOptions);
}
```

Save the file.

## Step 5: Preview the WebPart
Switch to your console, make sure you are still in the `jquery-webpart` folder and type the following to build and preview your web part:

```
gulp serve
```

> Visual Studio Code provides built-in support for gulp and other task runners. You can press Ctrl+Shift+B if you are in Windows or Cmd+Shift+B if you are in Mac within Visual Studio Code to debug and preview your web part.

Gulp will execute the tasks and open the local SharePoint Web Part Workbench.

In the page canvas, click the `+` to reveal the list of web parts available. 

You should see the jQuery web part.

Add the jQuery web part.

You should see the jQueryUI Accordion now!

## Next Steps
Switch to the console where you have `gulp serve` running and terminate the task by pressing `Ctrl+C`

This concludes our tutorial. In this tutorial, we saw how to define, load and unbundle external dependencies and successfully built a jQueryUI accordion web part.

In the [next ](./Using-Office-UI-Fabric-Components) tutorial, we will use Office UI Fabric in our client web part.
