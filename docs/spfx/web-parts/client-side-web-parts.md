# Client-side web parts in the SharePoint UX Framework

Client-side web parts are client-side components that run inside the context of a SharePoint page. Today, developers can build server-side web parts that are packaged and deployed to SharePoint. However, the server-side web parts are only available to on-premises and cannot be deployed to SharePoint online (Office 365).

Client-side web parts will:
* Enable developers to build web parts using HTML & JavaScript.
* Support both SharePoint online and on-premises environment.

Client-side web parts will support existing SharePoint server-side Pages and the new client-side pages. As a developer, you build your client-side web part once and run in both server-side and client-side SharePoint pages. 

At Dev Kitchen, you will be working with an early build of the client-side web part framework. What you see is not final and hence your feedback is more valuable than ever.

The following features in `preview` are available for you to try and provide feedback:
* Support for both classic SharePoint server-side page and client-side page
* SharePoint Web Part Workbench - A simple client-side page application to preview your web parts in development without the need to deploy them to SharePoint. 
* Client-side Property Pane with the following property types:
  * Textbox
  * Multi-line Textbox
  * Checkbox
  * Dropdown
  * Toggle
