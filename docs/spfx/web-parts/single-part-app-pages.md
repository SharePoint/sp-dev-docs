# Using single part app pages in SharePoint Online

Single part app pages provides a capability to host SharePoint Framework web parts or Teams applications in SharePoint Online with a locked layout. End users cannot modify or configure the page which is using the Single Part App Page layout.

App pages have following characteristics:

* Single Part App Pages cannot be edited by end users using a browser
* Currently supports hosting only single web part or Microsoft Teams application
* End users can create new app pages using the New--> Page experience available in modern sites.
* Developers can change page layout programatically from normal page layout to a Single Page App Page
* There's no New experience in a Single Page App Page. End users can create new Article pages or Single Page App pages by using the New/page experience present in the ribbon of any modern article pages.

App pages are exposed as an option in the modern page creation capability when you chose the used page layout for your page. All web parts which have been configured to be available also as an app page are available on the **Create page** capability.

Web part can be configured to be exposed as an app page. This configuration is performed in the web part manifest file by adjusting the `supportedHosts` value. Web part will be exposed as an option in the upcoming app pages picker user interface, if the `supportedHosts` value contains `"SharePointFullPage"` value.

Following web part manifest demonstrates scenario where the web part is included to be in all supported platforms by updating all different values for the `supportedHosts` parameter.
