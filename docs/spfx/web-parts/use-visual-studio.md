# Use Visual Studio to develop SharePoint client-side web parts

>**Note:** The SharePoint Framework is currently in Preview, and is subject to change based on customer feedback.  While weâ€™re in preview, SharePoint Framework web parts are not supported for use in production environments.

SharePoint Framework is client-side driven and uses a variety of open source tools to enable SharePoint development. It relies heavily on node and npm to provide you with a local/debug runtime environment and a robust package eco-system respectively. Tools like gulp, webpack etc., depend on the availability of node runtime environment. 

## Node.js Tools for Visual Studio 
With the help of [Node.js Tools for Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/features/node-js-vs.aspx), you can use Visual Studio as your primary IDE for building client-side web parts and applications. Node.js Tools for Visual Studio is a free, open source plugin that turns Visual Studio into a Node.js IDE. It is designed, developed, and supported by Microsoft and the community, just like the SharePoint Framework.

## Install Required Tools
- [Visual Studio 2015](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691978&clcid=0x409)
- Latest Visual Studio Update
    - [Visual Studio Update 3](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2015-update3-vs)
- [Node.js Tools for Visual Studio](https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejstools/releases/download/v1.2.Dev-7.20.2016/NTVS.Dev.2016-07-20.VS.2015.msi)

## Load SharePoint Client-side Project in Visual Studio
With little effort, you are able to load your SharePoint client-side project into Visual Studio. Follow the steps below to use Visual Studio as your development environment for building client-side web parts and applications.

> Please note this applies only to the preview release. It is expected the integration with Visual Studio will be improved as we progress towards the final release.

### Yo SharePoint
The first step is to create the SharePoint client-side project. We will use the Yeoman SharePoint Generator to create the project.

Create a new project directory in your favorite location:

```
md hello-vs-webpart
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd hello-vs-webpart
```

Create a new client-side web part project by running the Yeoman SharePoint Generator:

```
yo @microsoft/sharepoint
```

There are two ways to open your client-side project in Visual Studio. Ideally, we would only have one. To make sure you get the best experience with Visual Studio, use whichever steps works best for you.

### Import Project into Visual Studio
If opening the `.njsproj` doesn't work for you, you can try importing the client-side solution project into Visual Studio. We are working on getting project file properly created directly from scaffolding.

Open Visual Studio and Create a New Project

In the *New Project* dialog, select the *Templates->Other languages->TypeScript->Node.js* and then *From Existing Node.js code* project template.

Name the project the same name as your SharePoint client-side project, that is, *hello-vs-webpart*, and choose the location of the client-side project as the location, and click *OK*.

In the project wizard, choose the client-side project folder as the folder containing your Node.js code, and click *Next* to continue.

In the next step, Click *Next* to continue.

In the next step, Visual Studio should show the same client-side project folder as the location to save your Node.js project file.

Click *Finish* to import the client-side project into Visual Studio.

## Explore the Project
Now that Visual Studio has imported your client-side project, take a moment to explore the project in Visual Studio.

Notice how you got a npm package explorer as well (found by extending npm node in the project):

### Modify gulpfile.js
Open *gulpfile.js* in the root of the project and change the initial declaration of the variables from *let* to *var*.

```
var gulp = require('gulp');
var build = require('@microsoft/sp-build-web');
```

> This is a temporary workaround as Visual Studio does not support ES6 yet.

### Setup Project Startup File
For launching the project from within Visual Studio (F5), go to the project properties and change the following properties to its corresponding values as shown below:
- **Script (startup file)**: node_modules\gulp\bin\gulp.js
- **Script arguments**: serve

### Build and Debug Project
Your client-side project is now setup to work with Visual Studio.

Press F5 to build and debug your project in your favorite browser.

#### Notes on Debugging
JavaScript client-side development has relied on browser developer tools which provides a robust environment to debug web applications. While Visual Studio provides the key integration into SharePoint client-side projects, browser developer tools are still used as the primary debugging tool to debug your client-side projects. 

All of the major browsers have their corresponding developer tools. Below are the links to get started with the developer tools.

> We will publish debugging guidance as we progress towards the final release. 

- If you are using Chrome, you have [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools)
- If you are using IE, you have [IE Developer Tools](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg589507(v=vs.85).aspx)
- If you are using Edge, you have [Edge Developer Tools](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/documentation/f12-devtools-guide/)
- If you are using Firefox, you have [Firefox Developer Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools)

#### Task Runner Explorer - Executing Other Tasks
SharePoint Framework comes with a set of gulp tasks to simplify packaging your client-side solution and uploading your assets to CDN. These commands are usually accessed using the following commands:

```
gulp package-solution
gulp deploy-azure-storage
```

You will use Visual Studio's Task Runner to explore and execute the available commands within the client-side project. To open the Task Runner window, either:
- Press *Ctrl+Alt+BkSpace*, or,
- Navigate to the following menu item: *View->Other Windows->Task Runner Explorer*

Task Runner Explorer makes is easier to view available gulp commands and run them when needed. Just right click on a gulp command to reveal the context menu to run a specific command.
