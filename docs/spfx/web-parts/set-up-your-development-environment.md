# Set up your SharePoint client-side web part development environment

>**Note:** The SharePoint Framework is currently in Preview, and is subject to change based on customer feedback. While weâ€™re in preview, SharePoint Framework web parts are not supported for use in production environments.

To build SharePoint client-side web parts you can use Visual Studio, or your own custom development environment. You can use a Mac, PC, or Linux.

## Install developer tools

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) Long Term Support (LTS) version. If you already installed Node.js please check that you have the latest version using `node -v`. It should return the current [LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 
  * If you are using a Mac, it is recommended you use [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install and manage Node.js. 

2. Install a code editor. The steps and examples in this documentation use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but you can use any editor of your choice. 

3. If you are running on a PC, you need to also install Visual Studio and Python.

   To install Visual Studio and required tools and updates:
   * Install [Visual Studio 2015](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691978&clcid=0x409).
   * Install [Visual Studio Update 3](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2015-update3-vs) or later.
   * Install [Node.js Tools for Visual Studio](https://aka.ms/getntvs). 

   To install Python:
   * Install [Python 2.7.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Optionally, you may also find that the following tools come in handy:
  * [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler)
  * [Postman plugin for Chrome](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/introduction)
  * [Cmder for Windows](http://cmder.net/)
  * [Oh My Zsh for Mac](http://ohmyz.sh/)

## Install Yeoman and gulp
[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) helps you kick-start new projects, and prescribes best practices and tools to help you stay productive. SharePoint client-side development tools include a Yeoman generator for creating new web parts that also provides the following features:
* Common build tools.
* Common boilerplate code to help build webparts (base libraries).
* A common playground web site to host web parts for testing.

* Enter the following command to install Yeoman and gulp:

```
npm i -g yo gulp
```
 
## Install the Yeoman SharePoint generator
 
The Yeoman SharePoint web part generator helps you quickly create a SharePoint client-side solution project with the right toolchain and project structure.
 
* Enter the following command to install the Yeoman SharePoint generator:

```
npm i -g @microsoft/generator-sharepoint 
```
