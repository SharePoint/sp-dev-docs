# Design considerations for SharePoint client-side web parts

>The SharePoint Framework is currently in Preview, and is subject to change based on customer feedback. While we’re in preview, SharePoint Framework web parts are not supported for use in production environments.

## Overview
To get started designing web parts you will need to understand some foundation basics of Office UI Fabric which can be leveraged to determine a starting point for iconography, font ramp, color usage, animation and the responsive grid. Building from this foundation is a good starting point even if your goal is to depart visually in order to match your own company’s brand or look and feel.  

## Office UI Fabric React Components
Along with Office UI Fabric, Office UI Fabric React Components can be used to build your web parts. Fabric React is a responsive, mobile-first collection of robust components designed to make it quick and simple for you to create web experiences using the Office Design Language. 
In the To-Do List example below many Fabric components are leveraged in construct the To-Do List property pane that lets the page author configure a web part.

Example- To-Do List web part:

## Responsive behavior
Pages in the new SharePoint authoring experience utilize the Office UI Fabric responsive grid to help ensure that each page will look great. 

### Max width:
It is recommended that all web parts should be designed with a 100% max width to ensure that they will re-flow and function properly on any page. The page width and column widths is defined by the page template but can be modified by the author to get their desired layout. If a max pixel value is set in the web part there could be unexpected results in both functionality and layout when the page is seen at different widths.

### Min width:
All web parts should be designed to reflow as the page/column width gets smaller down to a min width of 320px.

## Web Part Published mode vs Edit mode
The new SharePoint page authoring experience has two modes. 
* **Published mode** which allows your team or audience to view content and interact with web parts. 
* **Edit mode** which allows page author(s) to add and configure web parts to add content to a page.
 
### Edit mode

#### Add hint and Toolbox:
The add hint is a horizontal line with a plus icon that is visible when a web part is selected and on hover to indicate where page authors can add new web parts to their page. The Toolbox opens when a user clicks/taps the plus icon. The Toolbox contains all the web parts that can be added to a page.

#### Toolbar:
A vertical toolbar and bounding box is part of the framework for every web part and provided by the page. Each web part has an edit and delete action in the toolbar. 

![Web part vertical toolbar](./images/design-wp-toolbar.png)

#### Contextual edits:
A WYSIWYG experience should be designed for web parts to fill in information or add content that will be displayed to the user when published. Entering this content should be done in page so the user understands how the viewer will see the content. Example: Titles and descriptions should be filled out where the text displays or new tasks should be added and modified in context of the page.

#### Item level edits:
UI can change with in the web part such as turning text into a text field to fill out links or when displaying UI to reorder items or to check of tasks in a web part

## Property Panes:
Property panes are invoked via the edit action icon on the toolbar. Panes should primarily contain configuration settings that enable/disable features that either show on page or that make a call to a service to display content.

There are 3 types of property panes to enable you to design and develop web parts that fit your business or customer needs.

### Single Pane
A single pane is used for simple web parts that only have a small number of properties to configure.

### Accordion Pane
A accordion pane is used for containing a group(s) of properties with many options and where the groups would result in a long scrolling list of options. For example, you might have 3 groups named Properties, Appearance and Layout each with 10 components. 

#### Accordion- One group open

#### Accordion- Two groups open and scrolled

### Property Pane Steps/Pages 

A steps pane is used for grouping properties in multiple steps or pages when you need the web part to be configured in a linear order or when choices made on the first step affects option that display on the second step.

**Step 1 of 3**

## Reactive vs Non-Reactive web parts
Reactive web parts are designed to be fully client side web parts which mean that each component that is configured in the properties pane will reflect as the change is made with in the web part on page. For the To-Do List web part unchecking “Completed Tasks” will hide this view in the web part.

![Reactive web part design](./images/design-wp-pp-reactive.png)

Non-Reactive web parts are not fully client side and generally one or more properties need to make a call to set/pull or store data on a server. In this case you should enable the Apply and Cancel buttons at the bottom of the properties pane.

## Constructing the To-Do List property pane
The To-Do List example uses the Single pane and is a reactive web part. The following shows each Fabric React component and the resulting design.

Drop down – to select tasks from an existing list

Checkbox– to allow authors to show or hide different views

Slider – to set the number of tasks visible

After selecting a list from the drop down the web part shows and indicator of items loading onto the page

When the new tasks are loaded the fade into view using animation styles from Office UI Fabric
