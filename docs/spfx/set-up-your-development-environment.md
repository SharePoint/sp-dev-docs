# Set up your SharePoint client-side web part development environment

>**Note:** The SharePoint Framework is currently in preview and is subject to change. SharePoint Framework client-side web parts are not currently supported for use in production environments.

You can use Visual Studio, or your own custom development environment to build SharePoint client-side web parts. You can use a Mac, PC, or Linux.

>**Note:** Before following the steps in this article, be sure to [Set up your Office 365 Tenant](./set-up-your-developer-tenant).

## Install developer tools

### NodeJS
Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) Long Term Support (LTS) version.

* If you have NodeJS already installed please check you have the latest version using `node -v`. It should return the current [LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 
* If you are using a Mac, it is recommended you use [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install and manage NodeJS. 

After installing node, make sure you are running V3 of npm by running the following command:
	
```
npm install -g npm@3
```

In case of Ubuntu Linux previous command might result in 'permission denied' message, so it should be instead executed as 

```
sudo npm install -g npm@3
```

### Code Editors
Install a code editor. You can use any code editor or IDE that supports client-side development to build your web part, such as:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io)
* [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm) 

The steps and examples in this documentation use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but you can use any editor of your choice. 

### If you're using a PC

You need to install *windows-build-tools*. windows-build-tools will install Visual C++ Build Tools 2015, provided free of charge by Microsoft. These tools areÂ required to compile popular native modules. It will also install Python 2.7, configuring your computer and npm appropriately. 

Run the following command:
	
```
npm install -g --production windows-build-tools
```

### If you are using Ubuntu

You need to install compiler tools using the following command:
	
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

### If you are using fedora

You need to install compiler tools using the following command:
	
```
sudo yum install make automake gcc gcc-c++ kernel-devel
```

## Install Yeoman and gulp

[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) helps you kick-start new projects, and prescribes best practices and tools to help you stay productive. SharePoint client-side development tools include a Yeoman generator for creating new web parts. The generator provides common build tools, common boilerplate code, and a common playground web site to host web parts for testing.

Enter the following command to install Yeoman and gulp:
	
```
npm install -g yo gulp
```

## Install Yeoman SharePoint generator

The Yeoman SharePoint web part generator helps you quickly create a SharePoint client-side solution project with the right toolchain and project structure.

Enter the following command to install the Yeoman SharePoint generator:
	
```
npm install -g @microsoft/generator-sharepoint 
```

## Optional tools

Here are some tools that might come in handy as well:

* [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler)
* [Postman plugin for Chrome](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/introduction)
* [Cmder for Windows](http://cmder.net/)
* [Oh My Zsh for Mac](http://ohmyz.sh/)
* [Git source control tools](https://git-scm.com/)
