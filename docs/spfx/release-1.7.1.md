# SharePoint Framework v1.7.1 release notes

This release is primarily a bug fix release to address few regressions and missed bugs that were introduced in the 1.7 release. This didn't contain any critical issues, we rather wanted to fix few inconveniences with the latest release.

**Released:** December 18, 2018
