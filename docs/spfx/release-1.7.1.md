# SharePoint Framework v1.7.1 release notes

This release is primarily a bug fix release to address few regressions and missed bugs that were introduced in the 1.7 release. This didn't contain any critical issues, we rather wanted to fix few inconveniences with the latest release.

**Released:** December 18, 2018

## Upgrading projects from v1.7 to v1.7.1

1. In the project's **package.json** file, identify all SPFx v1.7 packages. For each SPFx package:
    1. Uninstall the existing v1.7 package:

        ```console
        npm uninstall @microsoft/{spfx-package-name}@1.7
        ```

    1. Install the refreshed v1.7.1 package:

        ```console
        npm install @microsoft/{spfx-package-name}@1.7.1.0 --save --save-exact
        ```
