# Overview of SharePoint Framework Extensions (preview)

SharePoint Framework Extensions let developers extend the user experience of SharePoint, providing ways to customize more facets of the SharePoint experience including notification areas, the toolbars of SharePoint, and the views of list data. SharePoint Framework extensions are available for testing through Office 365 Developer Tenants during preview and later across all tenants, when they reach GA. 

> You can get a free Office 365 Developer Tenant by subscribing to the [Office 365 Developer Program](http://dev.office.com/devprogram).

SharePoint Framework Extensions add new capabilities to extend the user experience of SharePoint within modern pages and document libraries, while leveraging the familiar tools and libraries for client-side development coming from the SharePoint Framework. Specifically, the SharePoint Framework includes three new Extension types:

- **ApplicationCustomizers** allow developers to add script to the page, as well as access well-known HTML element placeholders and extend them with custom renderings
- **FieldCustomizers** can be used to provide modified views to data for fields within a list
- **CommandSets** let developers extend the command surfaces of SharePoint to add new actions, along with client-side code that can be used to implement behaviors

In addition to plain JavaScript projects, you can build extensions alongside common scripting frameworks, such as AngularJS and React. For example, you can use React along with components from Office UI Fabric React to quickly create experiences based on the same components used in Office 365.
