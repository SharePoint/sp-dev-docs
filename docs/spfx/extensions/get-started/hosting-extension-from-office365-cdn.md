## Enable the CDN in your Microsoft 365 tenant

Microsoft 365 CDN is the easiest way to host SharePoint Framework solutions directly from your tenant while still taking advantage of the Content Delivery Network (CDN) service for faster load times of your assets.

Follow the steps outlined in the following document to ensure the Microsoft 365 CDN is enabled in your tenant: [Enable the Microsoft 365 CDN](../../enable-Microsoft-365-content-delivery-network.md).

## Update your solution project for the CDN URLs

1. Return to the previously created solution and open the **./config/package-solution.json** file. Notice that the `includeClientSideAssets` attribute has to be set to `true` for automatic asset hosting through Microsoft 365 CDN. This controls if the JavaScript assets and related files are included in the **\*.sppkg** file* when solution is packaged for shipping.

    ```json
    {
      "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/spfx-build/package-solution.schema.json",
      "solution": {
        "name": "app-extension-client-side-solution",
        "id": "831b6fac-7668-46b4-96c6-e2ee35559287",
        "version": "1.0.0.0",
        "includeClientSideAssets": true,
        ...
      }
    }
    ```

1. Open **./config/write-manifests.json** file.

    This file should be updated *only* when you're using external CDN, such as Microsoft Azure. Ensure that the `cdnBasePath` attribute is exactly as shown below. If it has any other entry, automatic hosting with Microsoft 365 Public CDN won't work.

    ```json
    {
      "cdnBasePath": "<!-- PATH TO CDN -->"
    }
    ```

1. Execute the following tasks to bundle your solution. This executes a release build of your project.

    ```console
    gulp bundle --ship
    ```

1. Execute the following task to package your solution. This command creates the **./sharepoint/solution/app-extension.sppkg** package:

    ```console
    gulp package-solution --ship
    ```

1. Upload or drag-and-drop the newly created client-side solution package to the tenant app catalog. When prompted select the **Deploy** button to trust the solution. Notice the domain definition is updated as **SharePoint Online** as your assets will be now automatically hosted with Microsoft 365 CDN:

1. Install the new version of the solution to your site, and ensure that it's working properly. Notice that if you didn't remove the package with **https://localhost** installation before updating it in the app catalog, your site is automatically running the updated version and placeholders are rendered from the CDN.

Congratulations, you've enabled a public CDN in your Microsoft 365 tenant and taken advantage of it from your solution!
