## Upgrading projects from v1.10 to v1.11

1. In the project's **package.json** file, identify all SPFx v1.10 packages. For each SPFx package:
    1. Uninstall the existing v1.10 package:

        ```console
        npm uninstall @microsoft/{spfx-package-name}@1.10
        ```

    1. Install the refreshed v1.11 package:

        ```console
        npm install @microsoft/{spfx-package-name}@1.11 --save --save-exact
        ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be sure you update the **package-solution.json** with the new developers information as described in the article [Docs: SharePoint Framework toolchain - Update developer information](toolchain/sharepoint-framework-toolchain.md). Not providing such information will generate an error during gulp package-solution process.
