# Implement Continuous Integration and Continuous deployment using Azure Devops
Azure DevOps (Visual Studio Team Services / Team Foundation Server)  is a set of tools and services that will help a developer, or a team of developers, implement DevOps processes, Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment for their development projects.  
When building SharePoint Framework solutions you can easily leverage Azure DevOps to automate builds, unit tests and deployment.  

## Continuous Integration
Continuous integration (CI) will help you do things like build, run unit tests and package the solution every time code changes are detected.
