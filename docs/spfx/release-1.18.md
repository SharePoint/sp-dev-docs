### NodeJS v18 support

SharePoint Framework solutions now support NodeJS v18 as the default version.

### Support for Execute Action in Adaptive Card Extensions

Developers can use `Execute` action for both card view and quick view actions.

### BaseComponentsCardView as a new default card view for Adaptive Card Extensions

We introduce new default class for Adaptive Card Extensions card views. With these new class developers can specify a set of components that is rendered in a card view.

For more information on the new designs, see [Designing Viva Connections custom cards for your dashboard](./viva/design/designing-card.md).

```typescript
export abstract class BaseComponentsCardView<TProperties = {}, TState = {}, TParameters extends ComponentsCardViewParameters = ITextCardViewParameters> extends BaseCardView<TProperties, TState> {
    abstract get cardViewParameters(): TParameters;
}
```

Example usage:

```typescript
export class CardView extends BaseComponentsCardView<
  IHelloWorldAdaptiveCardExtensionProps,
  IHelloWorldAdaptiveCardExtensionState,
  ComponentsCardViewParameters
  > {
  public get cardViewParameters(): ComponentsCardViewParameters {

    return BasicCardView({
      cardBar: {
        componentName: 'cardBar',
        title: this.properties.title,
        icon: {
          url: this.properties.iconProperty
        }
      },
      header: {
        componentName: 'text',
        text: 'Hello world!'
      },
      footer: {
        componentName: 'cardButton',
        title: 'Quick View',
        action: {
          type: 'QuickView',
          parameters: {
            view: QUICK_VIEW_REGISTRY_ID,
          },
        },
      },
    });
  }
}
```

### Adaptive Card Extensions flexible card views

With this release, we introduce more flexible way to configure card views for Adaptive Card Extensions. Developers can now "mix and match" components in a card view configuration based on allowed set of [variations](./viva/design/designing-card.md).

Use new **Generic Card Template** in the generator to get started. Migration guide for existing projects is available [here](./viva/get-started/migrate-to-spfx-1-18.md).

### Ability to use text input in Adaptive Card Extensions' card views

Developers can now use text input component in a body or footer of a card view. For more information on the layout options, see [Designing Viva Connections custom cards for your dashboard](./viva/design/designing-card.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The text input component is fully supported in the browser and in Teams desktop. Full support for Viva Connections mobile will be enabled later.

### New Search Card Template for Adaptive Card Extensions

We introduce a new search card view for Adaptive Card Extensions that is intended to be used for search scenarios. Use new **Search Card Template** in the generator to get started.

> [!NOTE]
> The text input component is fully supported in the browser and in Teams desktop. Full support for Viva Connections mobile will be enabled later.

### Support onChange event for ACE TextInput and SearchBox

Developers can now use onChange event for TextInput and SearchBox components in Adaptive Card Extensions.

```typescript
/**
 * Text change event handler.
 */
onChange?: (newValue?: string) => void;
```
> [!NOTE]
> The `onChange` event for TextInput and SearchBox is fully supported in the browser and in Teams desktop. Full support for Viva Connections mobile will be enabled later.

### Ability to detect host's theme for Viva Connections Mobile

Starting with this version, developers have access to `hostContext` in the `AdaptiveCardExtensionContext` object. This property allows to detect host's theme.
```typescript

export type HostTheme = 'light' | 'dark' | undefined;

export interface IHostContext {
  /**
 *
 * theme is used to define what the the current colour scheme for the VCM app. It has currently 2 values
      light: If VCM is in light mode, we use the theme 'light',
      dark: If VCM is in dark mode, we use the theme 'dark'
 */
  theme: HostTheme;
}
```

### Fluent UI React v8 support

Starting from this version, React templates use Fluent UI React v8 instead of v7.

### Transparent outline icon for Teams-hosted web parts

The default outline icon for Microsoft Teams hosted web parts is now transparent. This ensures that the default icon meets the Microsoft Teams design requirements for application.

### TypeScript v4.7 Support

SPFx solutions now support TypeScript v4.7.

## Deprecations

- `BaseAdaptiveCardView` - use `BaseAdaptiveCardQuickView` instead
- `template` property in `BaseTemplateCardView` and its descendants

## Fixed Issues

- [#9010](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-docs/issues/9010) - Placeholder `{tenantDomain}` isn't replaced with `SPFX_SERVE_TENANT_DOMAIN`.

## Feedback and issues

We're interested on your feedback around the release. Do let us know any findings or other feedback using the [SPFx issue list](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-docs/issues).
