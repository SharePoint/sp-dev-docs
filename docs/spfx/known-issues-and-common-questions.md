# Known issues and frequently asked questions

This page is for listing any known issues or to answer any frequently asked questions around SharePoint Framework. 

## Known issues

**Dev certificate issue with Chrome (v58-)**

- *Date - 28th of April*
- *Updated - 2nd of May*

If you are using Chrome as your development browser, you might have challenges with the developer certificate regardless of executing `gulp trust-dev-cert` command. Chrome has changed its model for certificate validation starting from version 58 and you might see "Your connection is not private" warning when you are accessing the local workbench.

You should update your Yeoman template packages. We have updated certification creation logic in the *@microsoft/gulp-core-build-serve* package. In existing solutions, you can simply delete this folder and run `npm install` to get the updated package. You will also need to execute `untrust-dev-cert` and `trust-dev-cert` commands in your machine to address the certification creation logic issue.
