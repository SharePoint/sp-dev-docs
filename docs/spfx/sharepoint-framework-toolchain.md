# SharePoint Framework Toolchain

>**Note:** The SharePoint Framework is currently in preview and is subject to change. SharePoint Framework client-side web parts are not currently supported for use in production environments.

## Overview
The SharePoint Framework toolchain is the set of build tools, framework packages, and other items that manage building and deploying your client side projects. The toolchain helps you build client-side components like web parts. It also helps you test them in your local development environment with tools such as the SharePoint Workbench. And you can use the toolchain to package and deploy to SharePoint. The toolchain also provides you with a set of build commands that help you to complete key build tasks such as code compilation, packaging the client-side project into a SharePoint app package and more. 

## npm
Before diving into the various toolchain components, it’s important to understand how the SharePoint Framework uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), to manage different modules in the project. npm is one of the preferred open source package managers for JavaScript client-side development. 

A typically npm package consists of one or more reusable JavaScript code files called modules along with a list of dependency packages that it depends on. When you install the package, npm also installs those dependencies. The official [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/) consists of hundreds of packages that you can download to build your application. You can also [publish your own packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm) to npm and share them with other developers. SharePoint Framework not only uses some of the npm packages in the toolchain but also publishes its [own packages to the npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40microsoft%2Fsp-). 

### SharePoint Framework packages
SharePoint Framework consists of several npm packages that work together to help developers build client-side experiences in SharePoint. 

The following packages are in the SharePoint Framework:

* [@microsoft/generator-sharepoint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/generator-sharepoint) - A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) plug-in for use with the SharePoint Framework. Using this generator, developers can quickly set up a new client-side web part project with sensible defaults and best practices.

* [@microsoft/sp-client-base](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/sp-client-base) - Defines the core libraries for client-side applications built using the SharePoint Framework

* [@microsoft/sp-client-preview](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/sp-client-preview) - Contains SharePoint Framework libraries that are still under development. Once they are finalized, they will be refactored into separate npm packages.

* [@microsoft/sp-webpart-workbench](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/sp-webpart-workbench) - The SharePoint Workbench is a standalone environment for testing and debugging client-side web parts.

* [@microsoft/sp-module-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/sp-module-loader) - A module loader that manages versioning and loading of client-side components, web parts, and other assets. It also provides basic diagnostic services. It is built on familiar standards such as SystemJS and WebPack, and is the first part of the SharePoint Framework to load on a page.

* [@microsoft/sp-module-interfaces](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/sp-module-interfaces) - Defines several module interfaces that are shared by the SharePoint Framework module loader and also the build system.

* [@microsoft/sp-lodash-subset](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/sp-lodash-subset) - Provides a custom bundle of [lodash](https://lodash.com/) for use with the SharePoint Framework's module loader. To improve runtime performance, it only includes a subset of the most essential lodash functions.

* [@microsoft/sp-tslint-rules](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/sp-tslint-rules) - Defines custom tslint rules for usage with SharePoint client-side projects.

* [@microsoft/office-ui-fabric-react-bundle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/office-ui-fabric-react-bundle) - Provides a custom bundle of  [office-ui-fabric-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/office-ui-fabric-react) that is optimized for use with the SharePoint Framework's module loader.

### Common build tools packages
Along with the SharePoint Framework packages described previously, a common set of build tools are also used to perform build tasks such as compiling TypeScript code to JavaScript, and converting SCSS to CSS.

The following list of common build tools packages are in the SharePoint Framework:

* [@microsoft/sp-build-core-tasks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/sp-build-core-tasks) - A collection of tasks for the SharePoint Framework build system, which is based on gulp. The `sp-build-core-tasks` package implements operations specific to SharePoint such as packaging solutions and writing manifests.

* [@microsoft/sp-build-web](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/sp-build-web) - Imports and configures a set of build tasks that are appropriate for a build target that will run in a web browser (as opposed to a Node.js environment).This package is intended to be imported directly by a gulp file that uses the SharePoint Framework build system. 

* [@microsoft/gulp-core-build](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/gulp-core-build) - The core gulp build tasks for building TypeScript, HTML, less, and other build formats. This package depends on several other npm packages that contain the following tasks:
	- [@microsoft/gulp-core-build-typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/gulp-core-build-typescript)
	- [@microsoft/gulp-core-build-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/gulp-core-build-sass)
	- [@microsoft/gulp-core-build-webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/gulp-core-build-webpack)
	- [@microsoft/gulp-core-build-serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/gulp-core-build-serve)
	- [@microsoft/gulp-core-build-karma](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/gulp-core-build-karma)
	- [@microsoft/gulp-core-build-mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/gulp-core-build-mocha)

* [@microsoft/loader-cased-file](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/loader-cased-file) - A wrapper for webpack's [file-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/file-loader) that can be used to modify the casing of the resulting filename. This is useful in some scenarios, such as when using a content delivery network (CDN) that only allows lowercase filenames.

* [@microsoft/loader-load-themed-styles](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/loader-load-themed-styles) - A loader that wraps the loading of CSS in script equivalent to <code>require('load-themed-styles').loadStyles( /* css text */ )</code>. It is designed to be a replacement for style-loader.

* [@microsoft/loader-raw-script](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/loader-raw-script) - A loader that loads a script file's contents directly in a webpack bundle using an `eval(…)`.

* [@microsoft/loader-set-webpack-public-path](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/loader-set-webpack-public-path) -A loader that sets the __webpack_public_path__ variable to a value specified in the arguments, optionally appended to the SystemJs baseURL property.

## Scaffolding a new client-side project
The SharePoint generator scaffolds a client-side project with a web part. The generator also downloads and configures the required toolchain components for the specified client-side project.  

### Packages installation
The generator installs required npm packages locally in the project folder. npm allows you to install a package either locally to your project, or globally. There are benefits to both, but the  [general guidance](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/npm/npm-1-0-global-vs-local-installation/) is to install the npm packages locally if your code depends on those package modules. In the case of a web part project, your web part code depends on the various SharePoint and common build packages, and thus requires those packages to be installed locally. 

As the packages are installed locally, npm also installs the dependencies associated with each package. You can find the packages installed under the `node_modules` folder in your project folder. This folder contains the packages along with all of their dependencies. It is ideal that this folder contains dozens to hundreds of folders as npm packages are always broken down to smaller modules and thus resulting in dozens to hundreds of packages being installed. The key SharePoint Framework packages are located under the `node_modules\@microsoft` folder. The `@microsoft` is an npm scope that collectively represents [packages published by Microsoft](https://www.npmjs.com/~microsoft).

Every time you create a new project using the generator, the generator installs the SharePoint Framework packages along with its dependencies for that specific project locally. In this way, npm makes it easier to manage your web part projects without affecting other projects that are in the local dev environment. 

### package.json
The `package.json` file in the client-side project specifies the list of dependencies the project depends on. The list defines what dependencies to install. As described earlier, each dependency could contain several more. npm allows you to define both runtime and build dependencies for your package using the `dependencies` and `devDependencies` properties. The `devDependencies` property is used when you want to use that module in your code as in the case of building web parts.

Below is the `package.json` of the [helloworld-webpart](web-parts/get-started/build-a-hello-world-web-part):

```json 
{
  "name": "helloword-webpart",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "private": true,
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=0.10.0"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@microsoft/sp-client-base": "~0.1.12",
    "@microsoft/sp-client-preview": "~0.1.12"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@microsoft/sp-build-web": "~0.4.32",
    "@microsoft/sp-module-interfaces": "~0.1.8",
    "@microsoft/sp-webpart-workbench": "~0.1.12",
    "gulp": "~3.9.1"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "gulp bundle",
    "clean": "gulp nuke",
    "test": "gulp test"
  }
}
```

While there are lot of packages installed for the project, they are required only for building the web part in the dev environment. It is with the help of these packages, you are able to depend on the modules, and build, compile, bundle & package your web part for deployment. The final minified bundled version of the web part that you deploy to a CDN server or SharePoint does not include any of these packages. That said, you can also configure to include certain modules depending on your requirements. For more information, see [Add an external library to a web part](web-parts/basics/add-an-external-library).

### Working with source control systems
As project dependencies increase, the number of packages to install also increases. You don’t want to check in the `node_modules` folder, which contains all of the dependencies, into your source control system. You should exclude the `node_modules` from the list of files to ignore during check-ins. 

If you are using `git` as your source control system, the Yeoman scaffolded web part project includes a `.gitignore` file that excludes the `node_modules` folder among other things. 
When you check out, or clone, the web part project from your source control system the first time, run the command to initialize and install all the project dependencies locally:

```
npm i
```

npm will scan the `package.json` file and install the required dependencies. 

## Build tasks
SharePoint Framework uses [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as its task runner to handle processes like the following:

* Bundle and minify JavaScript and CSS files.
* Run tools to call the bundling and minification tasks before each build.
* Compile LESS or SASS files to CSS.
* Compile TypeScript files to JavaScript.

The toolchain consists of the following gulp tasks defined in the [@microsoft/sp-build-core-tasks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/sp-build-core-tasks) package:

* build
  * Builds the client-side solution project.
* bundle
  * Bundles the client-side solution project entry point and all its dependencies into a single JavaScript file.
* serve
  * Serves the client-side solution project and assets from the local machine.
* nuke
  * Cleans the client-side solution project's build artifacts from the previous build and from the build target directories (lib and dist)
* test
  * Runs unit tests, if available, for the client-side solution project. 
* package-solution
  * Packages the client-side solution into a SharePoint package.
* deploy-azure-storage
  * Deploys client-side solution project assets to Azure Storage. 

To initiate different tasks, append the task name with the gulp command. For example, to compile and then preview your web part in the SharePoint Workbench, run the following command:

```
gulp serve
```

>**Note**: You cannot execute multiple tasks at the same time.

The `serve` runs the different tasks and finally launches SharePoint Workbench.

![gulp serve task](../../images/toolchain-gulp-serve-task.png)

### Build targets
In the previous screenshot, you can see that the task indicates your build target as follows:

```
Build target: DEBUG
```

If no parameter is specified, the commands target the BUILD mode. If the `ship` parameter is specified, then the commands target the SHIP mode.

Usually, when your web part project is ready to ship or deploy in a production server, you will target SHIP. For other scenarios like testing and debugging you would target BUILD. The SHIP target also ensures that the minified version of the web part bundle is built. 

To target SHIP mode, you append the task with `--ship`:

```
gulp --ship
```

In DEBUG mode, the build tasks copy all of the web part assets, including the web part bundle, into the `dist` folder.

In SHIP mode, the build tasks copy all of the web part assets, including the web part bundle, into the `temp\deploy` folder.
