# Build your first SharePoint Adaptive Card Extension

Adaptive Card Extensions (ACEs) are a new SharePoint Framework component type, which enables developers to build rich, native extensions to Viva Connections' Dashboards and SharePoint Pages. Since Adaptive Card Extensions use Microsoft's Adaptive Card Framework to generate UI with its declarative JSON schema, you only need to focus on your component's business logic and let the SharePoint Framework (SPFx) handle making your component look good and work across all platforms.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This tutorial assumes you have installed the SPFx v1.18. For more information on installing the SPFx v1.18, see [SharePoint Framework v1.18 release notes](../../release-1.18.md).

## Scaffold an Adaptive Card Extension project

Create a new project directory for your project and change your current folder to that directory.

Create a new project by running the Yeoman SharePoint Generator from within the new directory you created:

```console
yo @microsoft/sharepoint
```

When prompted, enter the following values (*select the default option for all prompts omitted below*):

- **Do you want to allow tenant admin the choice of deploying the solution to all sites immediately without running any feature deployment or adding apps in sites?** Yes
- **Which type of client-side component to create?** Adaptive Card Extension
- **Which template do you want to use?** Generic Card Template
- **What is your Adaptive Card Extension name?** HelloWorld

At this point, Yeoman installs the required dependencies and scaffolds the solution files. This process might take few minutes.

### Update your project's hosted workbench URL

When you use the gulp task **serve**, by default it will launch a browser with the specified hosted workbench URL specified in your project. The default URL for the hosted workbench in a new project points to an invalid URL.

- Locate and open the file **./config/serve.json** in your project.
- Locate the property `initialPage`:

    ```json
    {
      "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/spfx-build/spfx-serve.schema.json",
      "port": 4321,
      "https": true,
      "initialPage": "https://{tenantDomain}/_layouts/workbench.aspx"
    }
    ```

- Change the `{tenantDomain}` domain to the URL of your SharePoint tenant and site you want to use for testing. For example: `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/devsite/_layouts/workbench.aspx`.

> [!TIP]
> You can also start the local web server without launching a browser by including the `nobrowser` argument to the **gulp serve** command. For example, you may not want to modify the **serve.json** file in all your projects and instead, use a bookmark to launch your hosted workbench.
>
> ```console
> gulp serve --nobrowser
> ```

## Serve the ACE in the workbench

Before digging into the code, run the scaffolded output and see what an Adaptive Card Extension looks like.

The inner development loop with ACEs is similar to SPFx Web Parts. We can serve locally and run the code on the workbench.

```console
gulp serve
```

Once local web server is running, navigate to the hosted Workbench: `https://{tenant}.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/workbench.aspx`

Open the **Web Part Toolbox** and select your ACE:

:::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-extensibility/lab1-toolbox.png" alt-text="Select the ACE from the toolbox":::

### Explore the Card View

ACEs can render in two distinct ways. The first way an ACE can render is called the **Card view**.

When rendered on a Dashboard or a Page, ACEs will always start in this view.

:::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-extensibility/lab1-hw-ace.png" alt-text="ACE rendered in Card View":::

### Explore the Quick View

The second way an ACE can render is called the **Quick View**. When you interact with an ACE, ACEs can launch a larger, customized experience.

> [!NOTE]
> ACE interaction is disabled while in **Edit** mode. The Workbench or Page must be in *Preview* or *Read* mode to interact with the ACE.

Switch the Workbench to **Preview** mode.

:::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-extensibility/lab1-preview.png" alt-text="Set the workbench to preview mode":::

Select the **Quick View** button on the ACE:

:::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-extensibility/lab1-hw-ql.png" alt-text="Select the Quick View button on the ACE":::

## Examine the scaffolded code

### Explore the base class

Locate and open the following file in your project: **./src/adaptiveCardExtensions/helloWorld/HelloWorldAdaptiveCardExtension.ts**.

```typescript
export default class HelloWorldAdaptiveCardExtension
  extends BaseAdaptiveCardExtension<IHelloWorldAdaptiveCardExtensionProps,IHelloWorldAdaptiveCardExtensionState> {
  // ...
}
```

All ACEs must extend from the `BaseAdaptiveCardExtension` class. You can optionally implement two generics:

- **TProperties**: Similar to Web Parts, this is the set of persisted properties of the component (*property bag*).
- **TState**: Unique to ACEs and can *optionally* define the set of renderable data.

### Rendering the ACE

```typescript
protected renderCard(): string | undefined {
  return CARD_VIEW_REGISTRY_ID;
}
```

The `renderCard()` method is `virtual` that returns a string identifier to a registered View; more on View registration later. This method is invoked during the **initial** render of the Card view.

If `renderCard()` isn't overridden, then a default Card view will be rendered.

Comment out the `renderCard()` method and see what happens:

```typescript
/*
protected renderCard(): string | undefined {
  return CARD_VIEW_REGISTRY_ID;
}
*/
```

:::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-extensibility/lab1-default.png" alt-text="Results of commenting the renderCard() method":::

Uncomment the `renderCard()` method to go back to the original state.

The default Card view will render using the following properties from the manifest:

- Icon: `iconProperty`
- Title: `title`
- Card text: `description`

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike with the Card view, there is no default Quick View.

### Register a view for the ACE

For a View to be used, it must be registered with its respective **ViewNavigator**. Two **ViewNavigator**s are exposed on the ACE: `cardNavigator` and `quickViewNavigator`:

```typescript
this.cardNavigator.register(CARD_VIEW_REGISTRY_ID, () => new CardView());
this.quickViewNavigator.register(QUICK_VIEW_REGISTRY_ID, () => new QuickView());
```

> [!NOTE]
> You must register a view before it can be used. You can do this within the class' constructor or `onInit()` method.

### Card Views

Locate and open the file: **./src/adaptiveCardExtensions/helloWorld/cardView/CardView.ts**.

Card views must extend `BaseComponentsCardView` and override `cardViewParameters` property to specify the look and data for the view.
There are multiple helper methods to simplify the creation of the predefined views:

- `BasicCardView`

    :::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-extensibility/lab1-basic-ace.png" alt-text="BasicCardView":::

- `ImageCardView`

    :::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-extensibility/lab1-image-ace.png" alt-text="ImageCardView":::

- `PrimaryTextCardView`

    :::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-extensibility/lab1-primary-ace.png" alt-text="PrimaryTextCardView":::

- `TextInputCardView`

    :::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-extensibility/lab1-textinput-ace.png" alt-text="TextInputCardView":::

Each of these Views will render differently and have different constraints on what data can be provided to the template.

As part of the `cardViewParameters` property, you can specify the following:
- **image**: Image parameters for the card view.
- **cardBar**: Card bar component for the card view (title and icon).
- **header**: Header components for the card view.
- **body**: Body components for the card view.
- **footer**: Footer components for the card view.

> [!NOTE]
> The card views for Adaptive Card templates are limited to predefined [permutations](../design/designing-card.md) and cannot be changed. The parameters type (`ComponentsCardViewParameters`) is defined to only accept the properties that are supported by the permutations.

Additionally, there are two generics for the `properties` and `state` objects shared between the view and the ACE.

- **TProperties**: The View's properties interface, the same interface used by persisted properties of the ACE (*property bag*).
- **TState**: Unique to ACEs and can *optionally* define the set of renderable data.

> [!NOTE]
> SPFx will automatically propagate changes to the ACE's state to each View.

> [!NOTE]
> Whereas the initial Card view is specified in the ACE's `renderCard()` method, the initial Quick View is specified as part of a `cardButton` component's action `parameters` in the footer. This allows two buttons to potentially open different views.

Add a second button by adding another object to the `footer` property returned from `cardViewParameters` property:

```typescript
public get cardViewParameters(): ComponentsCardViewParameters {
    return BasicCardView({
      cardBar: {
        componentName: 'cardBar',
        title: this.properties.title
      },
      header: {
        componentName: 'text',
        text: strings.PrimaryText
      },
      footer: [{
        componentName: 'cardButton',
        title: strings.QuickViewButton,
        action: {
          type: 'QuickView',
          parameters: {
            view: QUICK_VIEW_REGISTRY_ID
          }
        }
      }, {
        componentName: 'cardButton',
        title: 'Bing',
        action: {
          type: 'ExternalLink',
          parameters: {
            target: 'https://www.bing.com'
          }
        }
      }]
    });
  }
```

:::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-extensibility/lab1-large.png" alt-text="Rendered large ACE card":::

Now, when you select the **Bing** button, Bing will open in a new browser tab.

Initially, the Card is displayed in **Large** Card size. Let's switch to the **Medium** size to validate how the Card is looking in this size.

1. Change the Card size by going to the Property Pane and selecting **Medium**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-extensibility/lab1-size.png" alt-text="Select the card size":::

    :::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-extensibility/lab1-medium.png" alt-text="Rendered medium ACE card":::

2. Now, the **Bing** button is hidden because **Medium** Card size for cards without an image only shows one button in the footer.

The `onCardSelection()` method determines what will happen if the Card is clicked. If the `onCardSelection()` method isn't implemented, then nothing will happen when the Card is clicked.

1. Change the Card selection to open the **Quick View** by modifying the `onCardSelection()` method:

    ```typescript
    public get onCardSelection(): IQuickViewCardAction | IExternalLinkCardAction | undefined {
      return {
        type: 'QuickView',
        parameters: {
          view: QUICK_VIEW_REGISTRY_ID
        }
      };
    }
    ```

2. Now, when you select the Card, it will open the Quick View.

### ACE Quick Views

Locate and open the following file: **./src/adaptiveCardExtensions/helloWorld/quickView/QuickView.ts**.

Quick Views must extend the **BaseAdaptiveCardView** base class. There are three optional generics that can be defined:

- **TData**: The type returned from the `data()` getter method.
- **TProperties**: Similar to the Card view, this is the same interface used by persisted properties of the ACE (*property bag*).
- **TState** Similar to the Card view, this is the set of stateful data the View needs to render. **TState** must share properties with the ACE's state interface.

A Quick View has more control over the Adaptive Card template schema than a Card view. The
`template()` getter must return valid Adaptive Card template JSON. SPFx ACEs support Adaptive Card
templating. The properties on the object returned from the `data` getter will automatically be mapped
to the bound template slot.

For example, `${subTitle}` is bound to `strings.SubTitle`.

```typescript
// QuickView.ts
public get data(): IQuickViewData {
  return {
    // ...
    subTitle: strings.SubTitle
  };
}
```

```json
// QuickViewTemplate.json.ts
{
  "type": "TextBlock",
  "weight": "Bolder",
  "text": "${subTitle}",
  "wrap": true
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> You must use the Adaptive Card binding syntax that uses `$` and `{}` brackets.

Let's change this:

1. Make `subTitle` a part of `IHelloWorldAdaptiveCardExtensionState`, and add two buttons.
1. Update the `data()` method as shown in the following code:

    ```typescript
    public get data(): IQuickViewData {
      return {
        subTitle: this.state.subTitle,
        title: strings.Title
      };
    }
    ```

1. Locate and open the following file: **./src/adaptiveCardExtensions/helloWorld/HelloWorldAdaptiveCardExtension.ts**.
1. Update the `IHelloWorldAdaptiveCardExtensionState` interface and `onInit()` method as follows:

    ```typescript
    export interface IHelloWorldAdaptiveCardExtensionState {
      subTitle: string;
    }

    ..

    public onInit(): Promise<void> {
      this.state = {
        subTitle: 'No button clicked'
      };
      // ...
    }
    ```

In its `template()` getter, the Quick View of the ACE you generated returns the object from a JSON file. Let's now modify that template:

1. Locate and open the following file: **./src/adaptiveCardExtensions/helloWorld/quickView/template/QuickViewTemplate.json**.
1. Replace the contents of this file with the following JSON:

    ```json
    {
      "schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
      "type": "AdaptiveCard",
      "version": "1.5",
      "body": [
        {
          "type": "TextBlock",
          "weight": "Bolder",
          "text": "${title}"
        },
        {
          "type": "ColumnSet",
          "columns": [
            {
              "type": "Column",
              "items": [
                {
                  "type": "TextBlock",
                  "weight": "Bolder",
                  "text": "${subTitle}",
                  "wrap": true
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "type": "ActionSet",
          "actions": [
            {
              "type": "Action.Submit",
              "title": "Button One",
              "style": "positive",
              "data": {
                "id": "button1",
                "message": "Clicked Button One"
              }
            },
            {
              "type": "Action.Submit",
              "title": "Button Two",
              "data": {
                "id": "button2",
                "message": "Clicked Button Two"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

Test your changes by refreshing the hosted workbench in the browser. It should pickup the changes you've applied to the project if **gulp serve** is still running:

:::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-extensibility/lab1-new-ql.png" alt-text="Updated ACE Quick View":::

> [!TIP]
> Learn more about Adaptive Cards at [adaptivecards.io](https://adaptivecards.io). This site also includes an Adaptive Cards Designer that lets you preview the rendering and structure of adaptive cards as you create them.

At this point, you've modified your ACE to include two new buttons in the Quick View card. The next step is to implement what happens when these buttons are selected. This is done using *action handlers*.

### Action handlers

Actions are handled by the views where they're defined.

The Quick View has two buttons, but the view is currently not handling the **Submit** action. The `onAction()` method is invoked whenever an Adaptive Card Action is executed, for instance when the **Action.Submit** action is initiated.

Locate and open the file **QuickView.ts** and override the `onAction()` to handle the two button selections as shown in the following code:

```typescript
import { ISPFxAdaptiveCard, BaseAdaptiveCardQuickView, IActionArguments } from '@microsoft/sp-adaptive-card-extension-base';

..

public onAction(action: IActionArguments): void {
  if (action.type === 'Submit') {
    const { id, message } = action.data;
    switch (id) {
      case 'button1':
      case 'button2':
        this.setState({
          subTitle: message
        });
        break;
    }
  }
}
```

Test your changes by refreshing the hosted workbench in the browser. It should pickup the changes you've applied to the project if **gulp serve** is still running.

Selecting either button will now set the state's `subTitle` to the `data.message` value, causing a re-render (*more on this later*). The Quick View's Adaptive Card will now display this message, since its template binds to `subTitle`.

### Property Pane

Similar to web parts, ACE's can have configurable properties that are set by users with appropriate permissions. These enable you to customize each implementation of your ACE. This is done using the property pane.

ACEs can be configured just like Web Parts. The API signatures are identical for the following methods, found in the **HelloWorldAdaptiveCardExtension.ts** file:

- `getPropertyPaneConfiguration()`
- `onPropertyPaneFieldChanged()`

The default scaffolding for ACEs uses a new API that aims to minimize the bundle size when the component isn't in **Edit** mode. The `loadPropertyPaneResources()` method utilizes Webpack's chunking feature to separate the Property Pane specific code into its own JS file, which can then be loaded on demand.

In addition to returning the Property Pane configuration, the **HelloWorldPropertyPane** class is used to encapsulate all your **Edit** mode logic.

### Properties

Other than the **Card size** field, the scaffolded ACE has one (1) configurable field, which is defined in `getPropertyPaneConfiguration()` method & defined in the **IHelloWorldAdaptiveCardExtensionProperties** interface:

- `title`

Card views are designed to automatically work across all card sizes. Aside from specifying a default card size, ACEs cannot control this property.

The `title` value is used in the title of the Property Pane and the title displayed on the Card.

```typescript
 public get cardViewParameters(): ComponentsCardViewParameters {
    return BasicCardView({
      cardBar: {
        componentName: 'cardBar',
        title: this.properties.title,
        // ...
```

You can also use the `iconProperty` property to specify an icon for your ACE. By default the value is specified as `iconImageUrl` in the manifest.

```typescript
protected get iconProperty(): string {
  // return icon url string
}
```

### State

The `state` property must be initialized before calling the `setState()` method, and it can only be initialized once.

```typescript
public onInit(): Promise<void> {
  this.state = {
    subTitle: 'No button clicked'
  };
  // ...
}
```

Unlike with `properties`, `state` isn't persisted past the current session and should only be used for ephemeral View state.

### Re-rendering

Re-rendering happens when a property is updated in the PropertyPane or if `setState()` is called.

As described above, when changing a **subTitle**  property during Quick View action handling, the `setState()` method is called:
```typescript
public onAction(action: IActionArguments): void {
  if (action.type === 'Submit') {
    const { id, message } = action.data;
    switch (id) {
      case 'button1':
      case 'button2':
        this.setState({
          subTitle: message
        });
        break;
    }
  }
}
```

Passing a `Partial<TState>` object to `setState()` method will update all Views with the new values.

If no value or identical values are passed, a re-render will still occur.

The `setState()` method isn't just limited to the Property Pane. It can be used in response to receiving new data or as a result of some user action.
