# Adaptive Card Extensions and Teams Apps

This tutorial builds off the following tutorial: [Advanced Quick View Functionality](advanced-quick-view-functionality.md).

Adaptive Card Extensions can be used as supplemental pieces to a larger Teams App story. An ACE on the Viva Connections Dashboard can link directly to a Teams Personal Tab or Bot.

In this tutorial, you'll use an ACE within a Microsoft Teams app.

## Scaffold a SPFx Teams Personal App

Start with the solution from the previous tutorials and add a new SPFx component to the project using the SPFx generator. Execute the following statement in command prompt from your project's root folder:

```console
yo @microsoft/sharepoint
```

When prompted, accept the default option for all prompts by the generator.

At this point, Yeoman installs the required dependencies and scaffolds the solution files. This might take a few minutes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There's a known issue where installation of all dependencies will fail after when the generator executes the **npm install** command.
>
> To work around this error, locate and open the following file in the project: **./package.json**.
>
> Remove the dependency **@microsoft/sp-webpart-workbench** from the `devDependencies` section of the file.
>
> Now, execute the following command in the console from your project's root folder:
>
> ```console
> npm install
> ```

### Edit the manifest

Locate and open the following file in the project: **./src/webparts/helloWorld/HelloWorldWebPart.manifest.json**.

Update the `supportedHosts` array to only support use within a Teams Personal Tab:

```json
"supportedHosts": ["TeamsPersonalApp"]
```

### Package and deploy the solution

Now package and deploy the solution to your SharePoint Online Tenant App Catalog:

Start by building the solution in production mode:

```console
gulp bundle --ship
```

Next, package the solution using the **package-solution** task:

```console
gulp package-solution --ship
```

Add your solutions package file (**\*.sppkg** located in the **./sharepoint/solution** folder) and upload it to Tenant
App Catalog.

When you deploy the solution, ensure the **Make this solution available to all sites in the organization** box is selected:

:::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-extensibility/lab4-deploy.png" alt-text="Ensure the solution is deployed to all sites in the tenant":::

Now, deploy the solution to the Microsoft Teams app store for your tenant by selecting the **Sync to Teams** button:

### Add a new Personal Tab

With the solution deployed, let's test it within the Microsoft Teams client.

Navigate to the to [Microsoft Teams web client](https://teams.microsoft.com), sign in, and select on the `...` icon in the left-most navigation.

Select the **More apps** link:

:::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-extensibility/lab4-apps.png" alt-text="Microsoft Teams More Apps":::

You should see your newly uploaded Teams Personal App. Select it and then select **Add**.

Open your new Personal Tab and copy the following highlighted portion from the URL. This is the Microsoft Teams app ID. You'll need this later in this tutorial:

:::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-extensibility/lab4-url.png" alt-text="Microsoft Teams App ID":::

## Scaffold a second ACE

Create a second ACE using the SPFx generator by executing the following statement in command prompt from your project's root folder:

```console
yo @microsoft/sharepoint
```

When prompted, enter the following values (*select the default option for all prompts omitted below*):

- **Which type of client-side component to create?** Adaptive Card Extension
- **What is your Adaptive Card Extension name?** TeamsHelloWorld
- **What is your Adaptive Card Extension description?** TeamsHelloWorld description

### Add a Teams deep link

Microsoft Teams deep links have the following format: `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/{appID}/{entityID}`

1. Replace `{appID}` with the Microsoft Teams app ID value you copied in the last step.
1. Replace `{entityID}` with `0`.

> [!TIP]
> To learn more about deep links in Microsoft Teams apps, see [Microsoft Teams: Create deep links](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/deep-links).

> [!NOTE]
> If you're linking to a non-SPFx Teams App, the `entityID` value is the entity ID specified in the Static Tabs section of the Teams manifest.

Locate and open the following file in the project: **./src/adaptiveCardExtensions/teamsHelloWorld/cardView/CardView.ts**.

Update the `onCardSelection()` method to open a deep link:

```typescript
public get onCardSelection(): IQuickViewCardAction | IExternalLinkCardAction | undefined {
  return {
    type: 'ExternalLink',
    parameters: {
      isTeamsDeepLink: true,
      target: '' // Set this to your Teams deep link URL
    }
  };
}
```

Repeat the steps in the section [Package and deploy the solution](#package-and-deploy-the-solution) above to rebuild, package, and deploy the updated solution.

## Viva Connections Dashboard

The Viva Connections Dashboard is available on the Home Site of the tenant.

:::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-extensibility/lab4-new.png" alt-text="SharePoint home site New menu":::

### Add cards to the dashboard

From the **New** menu, select the **Dashboard** item to create a new dashboard. Add the ACE to the dashboard by selecting **Add Card**:

:::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-extensibility/lab4-add.png" alt-text="Add ACE to dashboard":::

Add your HelloWorld and TeamsHelloWorld ACEs to the Dashboard. When finished, publish the Dashboard.

### Deep link

Select the **TeamsHelloWorld** ACE. The Microsoft Teams desktop client will automatically open to the Personal App you previously created.

## Conclusion

After this lab you should be familiar with:

- Packaging and deployment of heterogeneous SPFx solutions
- Manually creating a Teams deep link URL
- Deep linking from an ACE to a Teams Personal Tab
