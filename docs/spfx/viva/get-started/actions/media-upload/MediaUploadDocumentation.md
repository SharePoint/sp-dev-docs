# Media upload in Adaptive Card Extension

Microsoft added support for an action to upload media, unique to Viva Connections, in the [SharePoint Framework (SPFx) v1.15.2](../../../../release-1.15.2.md) release.

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial also assumes that you've already built an SPFx Adaptive Card Extension.

## Action type for media upload

### Select Media

Allows users to upload media content via an Adaptive Card Extension (ACE). The current size limitation is 1 MB per image. A user may specify any image type to be uploaded.

> [!WARNING]
> If an image type isn't specified, then an error indicating only images can be uploaded is displayed.

The ACE action for Select Media is: `VivaAction.SelectMedia`.

```json
{
  "type": "VivaAction.SelectMedia",
  "id": "Select Media",
  "title": "Select Files",
  "parameters": {
    "mediaType": "MediaType.Image"
  }
}
```

The parameters that it takes are as follows:

- `mediaType`: Currently set as image by default. Audio and documents, such as PDFs, are supported as well.
- `allowMultipleCapture` [OPTIONAL]: Enables multiple files to be added at once.
  - This is enabled by default.
- `maxSizePerFile` [OPTIONAL]: The limitation for the file size to be uploaded, suggested limitation is 1 MB.
- `supportedFileFormats` [OPTIONAL]:  Space delimited format on allowed types. If none are supplied, then standard image files are used for type checking.
  - Any file that is attempted to be upload that doesn't match the allowed type results in an error message stating: _This isn't a file type we support. You can only upload images._

```typescript
{
    /**
     * Specify the specific media type that should be selected
     */
    mediaType: MediaType;
    /**
     * Allow multiple images to be selected.
     */
    allowMultipleCapture?: boolean;
    /**
     * Max file size that can be uploaded.
     */
    maxSizePerFile?: number;
    /**
     * File formats supported for upload.
     */
    supportedFileFormats?: string[];
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> If a user uploads a file that is not supported in the format parameters, an error code of **InCorrectFileFormat** is thrown.
