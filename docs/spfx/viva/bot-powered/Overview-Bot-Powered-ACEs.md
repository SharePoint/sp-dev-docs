# Overview of Bot Powered Adaptive Card Extensions

Bot Powered Adaptive Card Extensions (ACEs) for Microsoft Viva Connections can be used to build custom experiences for the  Microsoft Viva Connections Dashboard using the Bot development model. Bot Powered ACEs are an addition to the already existing Viva Connections extensibility model, which is based on SharePoint Framework (SPFx) components.

Objective of the Bot Powered ACEs is to enable existing Microsoft Teams developers, with existing bot implementations, extend their bot implementations to be available in the Viva Connections. Bot Powered ACEs are packaged using the Microsoft Teams solution model, enabling the same bot to be used in both Microsoft Teams and in Microsoft Viva Connections.

While with SPFx components you create client-side solutions to extend Viva Connections, using the Bot Powered ACEs you can apply server-side solutions. Depending on your requirements, objectives, expertise, and scenario you can choose between these two options that are complementary and not alternative.

In the following picture, you can see an Adaptive Card Extension to collect user's feedback in action in the desktop experience of Viva Connection Dashboard. The ACE was implemented as a Bot Powered ACE.

From a developer point of view, you build the ACE once and you can benefit of it in both desktop and mobile experiences.
