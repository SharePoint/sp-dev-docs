# Designing Viva Connections custom cards for your dashboard

## Principles

Cards are used to link resources, surface information, and power direct interaction with applications.

**Integrate rather than duplicate:** Take advantage of the experiences already available on your intranet, such as task assignments and completion, shift schedules, company policies, and more.

**Stay in context:** Design cards to avoid making users jump around to different experiences. For example, it's ideal if you can keep interactions within the Viva Connections app using Quick view (link to quick view page here). The next best is to keep user interactions within the dashboard.

**Bring cards to life with relevant and dynamically refreshable data:** Company stock price, due dates for training or projects, task assignment updates, and remaining vacation days are some examples.

## Anatomy of cards

The Connections dashboard is made up of cards that each serve a specific purpose. Each card is a container and is comprised of the following sections and elements:  

**Medium card Layout:**

**Large card layout:**

:::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-design/img-large-card-layout.png" alt-text="Diagram showing the large card container and card elements, showing the Time off and paid time off available options.":::

The first section is the **card bar**, which includes the cardâ€™s icon and title.

- **Icon**: Unique visual representation of this card. You can choose the icon from the pre-defined set or upload a customized icon.

  > [!NOTE]
  > For customized icons, the maximum size is 24 px by 24 px. Recommended formats are PNG or SVG. SVG icons scale better across different screen resolutions. Make sure the icon has a transparent background, and it looks good both on light and dark themes.

- **Title**: Typically the app name. All titles should be in sentence case.

The second section is the **header**, which will be the most prominent words on the card.

- This content is likely to be read first. It's used to communicate the most information and keywords. Heading text can be static or dynamically updated. All headings should be in sentence case.

The third section is referred to as the **body**.

- The body can contain elements such as text input, a search box, or a text description.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Use text when the description can add valuable secondary informational value to the heading and can make it easier to understand the purpose of the card. Avoid repeating information already communicated in the heading.  

Finally, the last section of the card is the **footer**.

- The footer section can contain an action button, text input, or a search footer.

## Card components and layouts

As part of the SPFX 1.18, we introduced card components  to enhance Adaptive Card Extension layouts.  These components are the building blocks of card layouts, representing individual elements within a card. Here are **card components** available:

- Card Bar Component
- Text
- Text input
- Action button
- Search box
- Search footer  

With the card components approach, we provide two types of card layout templates, each offering developers varying degrees of flexibility and customization: 

1. **Generic card layout template**
   1. The generic card template serves as a foundational or base card with no predefined elements/ components.
   1. Developers can utilize this template to fully customize card design layouts according to their specific needs. 
1. **Scenario-focused card layout template**
   1. Scenario-focused templates are designed to address specific customer needs, delivering tailored solutions for distinct scenarios. 
   1. These templates come with pre-built user experiences, enabling developers to initiate their projects swiftly and effortlessly.

### Generic card layout template

While the generic card layout offers developers significant flexibility in customizing the card design, we have established a specific set of component combinations in accordance with our design language and guidelines. This approach not only ensures adherence to our design principles but also guarantees a superb user experience for our customers.

**Examples of the generic card with an image (Allowed combinations)**

| Combination 	| Card bar 	| Header 	|  Body 	 |  Footer 	     | Notes                                 	| Sample Card 	|
|:-----------:	|:--------:	|:------------:	|:-----:	 |:-------:	     |---------------------------------------	|-------------	|
|     1     	|    Yes   	|     Text     	| Empty 	 | Action button | Previously known as the Image template 	| :::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-design/img-permutation-01-card-layout.png" alt-text="Generic card with image permutation 1."::: |

|     5     	|    Yes   	|     Text     	| Text input | Empty         | New layout                             	| :::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-design/img-permutation-05-card-layout.png" alt-text="Generic card with image permutation 5."::: |

> [!NOTE]
> When using images on a card, note: Images draw the viewer's eye, so use images carefully either to create recognition of a familiar app or website or increase the overall visual prominence of the card on the dashboard. The image should meaningfully connect to the heading and/or title.

> [!NOTE]
> Search box and search footer components can't be used in generic card template layout.

#### Recommended best practice for the generic card layout template and components      

- When adding the text in the heading and body sections, ensure the text does not truncate and can fit in the card width on both desktop and mobile in both card sizes and all languages used. Truncated text can hide key information that might be necessary for the end user to complete the task. For the header, in most cases, a length of 10-12 characters should fit the card width well. 
- Whenever you use a text input component, we highly recommend adding an icon button. Although we allow an icon before and an icon after the text input component, we recommend using one icon to clearly communicate the intent of the card.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The icon before the text input disappears once the textbox is active.

- Generally, we do not recommend using text input with an action button AND extra action buttons in the footer BUT if there is a text input with a button AND extra buttons in the footer - we recommend using a secondary button style (default or undefined value for the button style property)
- Although we do support the entire card being clickable, we do not recommend having a selection action on a card if there is a text input in the body or it's a search card. This will not provide a great user experience
- While we do allow the entire card to be clickable, we strongly advise against enabling selection actions on a card if it contains text input in the body or is a search card template. Doing so will result in a suboptimal user experience.


### Scenario-focused card layout template

#### Search template

This scenario-focused card template allows developers to quickly create a search experience for the users. Examples include people, messages or chats, files etc.

:::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-design/img-search-template.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the search card, primary button, and secondary button interactions.":::

## Interaction

There are three possible ways to interact with a card:

- Card (the entire card can be clickable)
- Primary button
- Secondary button

:::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-design/img_card_interactions.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of the image card, primary button, and secondary button interactions.":::

Each of these interactions can be customized. Use these to perform an instant action, send a request to the server, open a quick view (add link), link to a Teams app, open an external website and so on.

Here are the best practices for designing card interactions:

- The overall card should always be interactive.
- If the primary button is used, because of its visual prominence, it should be the most important action on the card.
- The secondary button can used either on its own or in conjunction with the primary button if two actions are needed (only available in large-size card layouts). If it's used with the primary button, make sure it is linked to the second most important action on the card. In that case, the card itself will become the least important action.
- For button labels, use concise and clear text that accurately reflects button behavior. For example 'View tasks' can be better than only 'View'.
- Make sure each interaction on the card is unique.
- Design cards to avoid making users jump around to different experiences. For example, it's ideal if you can keep interactions within the Viva Connections app using Quick view. The next best is to keep user interactions within the dashboard.

> [!NOTE]
> Due to lack of space:
>
> - Heading + Image layout does not have buttons with medium size cards.
> - Heading and Heading + Description layouts can only have one button with medium size cards.

### Examples

â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹Here are some example cards for how these layouts can be used

:::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-design/img_card_collections.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot showing various example cards, including cards for Shifts, Tasks, COVID 19, and Tutorials.":::

## Platforms and modes

Dashboard cards are supported on iOS, Android, and Web. However, there are slight differences in the styling between different platforms â€“ fonts (Segoe UI for desktop, Roboto for Android, SF Display Pro for iOS), colors, sizes, and spacing are slightly tweaked to better suit the respective platform and make the cards look consistent with the overall experience of that platform.

:::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-design/img_card_platforms.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot showing how the same card appears on web, iOS, and Android platforms.":::

Dashboard cards also support both light and dark mode themes. Ensure that the colors you use work for both modes â€“ text should be legible, and buttons and icons should be clearly recognizable against the background. To meet accessibility criteria, text should have a color ratio of 4.5:1 against the button background, and non-text components like icon should have a color ratio of 3:1 against the background. [Use this tool to check color contrast](https://fluentuipr.z22.web.core.windows.net/heads/master/theming-designer/index.html).

### Displaying your app in the toolbox

New cards are added to that dashboard using the following toolbox.

:::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-design/img_card_toolbox.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of the Relecloud screen showing the Dashboard, which displays various tools.":::

To display your custom app in the dashboard picker, you will need the following:

:::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-design/img_card_toolbox2.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of the dashboard with a focus on the icon, title, and descriptive text for each tool in the dashboard.":::

**1. Icon:** Unique visual representation of this app. Your custom icon maximum size is 24 px by 24 px and should preferably in PNG or SVG format. SVG icons scale better across different screen resolutions. It is preferable to use a monochromatic icon, but you can use color icons if you want to represent your unique brand with the icons. Either way, make sure the icon has a transparent background, and it looks good both on light and dark theme. [â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹Learn about SharePoint themes](/sharepoint/dev/declarative-customization/site-theming/sharepoint-site-theming-overview). The same icon is to be used for the dashboard card (see above).

**2. Title:** Make sure the title of the app is concise and is not truncated. Recommended length is 10-12 characters. The same title should be used for the dashboard card (see above) and the quick view (link quick view page) (if used). If you have multiple apps, it is recommended that each app has a unique title. All titles should be in sentence case.

**3. Descriptive text:** A clear, concise description explains the purpose of the card and provides information about how to use it. It should show up in the tooltip on hover (in web). Make sure the text wraps appropriately and is not too wide or too narrow in the tooltip. The optimal line length is considered to be 50-60 characters per line, including spaces.

### Defining settings for the card

When the app is clicked, the card is displayed on the dashboard. The card can be edited using the settings panel on the right.

:::image type="content" source="../../../images/viva-design/img_card_settings.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of the Rerecloud application showing an edit pane that allows the user to edit the title, heading, and description of a card.":::

Here are some best practices for offering customization settings:

- Include descriptive text that explains the purpose of the card and provides information about how to use it. Ensure that this is either the same text as the tooltip or adds to it.
- Unless the text on the card is dynamically updated, allow users to edit the text on the card to tailor it to their needs. Consider providing prewritten default text in the fields that the user can override and edit as necessary.
- If multiple cards are available from the same organization, ensure that labels and interactions in the settings panel are consistent across all the cards.
- If there are multiple settings and the card is complex in design, it is recommended to add a "Learn more" link where users can find best practices for adding your card to their dashboard, for example, recommended size, example cards, and so on.
