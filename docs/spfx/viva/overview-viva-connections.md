# Overview of Viva Connections Extensibility

Developers can extend [Microsoft Viva Connections](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva) for building engaging experiences with the widely adopted SharePoint Framework (SPFx). Viva Connections is your gateway to a modern employee experience where you can build and integrate apps that shape culture and foster connections to help employees thrive. With SPFx, you have multiple ways to extend â€“ using the same out-of-the-box or custom SPFx web parts, SPFx extensions (e.g., header, footer), and specific components for optimized mobile experiences.
