# Overview of Viva Connections Extensibility

[Microsoft Viva Connections](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva) is available as a desktop via the installable Microsoft Teams client, tablet and as mobile app in Microsoft Teams. All of these experiences, desktop & mobile, use the **SharePoint Framework (SPFx) for all customizations and extensibility opportunities**.

Viva Connections has a set of out of the box cards that are exposed through the dashboard feature. This dashboard **can be adjusted and configured based on the company requirements**. You can introduce new cards and experiences based on your business requirements.

Viva Connections dashboard is available in the desktop, tablet and mobile experiences. It enables end users to easily access the most relevant information and applications directly for their role in the dashboard. You can personalize or introduce separate dashboards based on audiences, which can be created using your company requirements.

> [!TIP]
> See the [Extend Microsoft Viva Connections learning path](https://aka.ms/m365/dev/learn/connections) for a structured way to learn how you can extend Viva Connections, what tools you need, and how to get started.

## Extensibility opportunities

Viva Connections personalization and extensibility model is based on the **Adaptive Card Extensions (ACEs)** which can be created using the widely adopted SharePoint Framework (SPFx) as client-side extensibility.

To learn more about customizing modern pages in SharePoint with SPFx, see [Overview of SPFx client-side web parts](../web-parts/overview-client-side-web-parts.md) & [Overview of SPFx Extensions](../extensions/overview-extensions.md).

### Viva Connections desktop experience

The Viva Connections desktop experience can be extended and customized using Adaptive Card Extensions (ACEs). Developers can use SPFx  to introduce new Viva Connections Adaptive Card extensions to customize the dashboard based on the business requirements.

### Viva Connections mobile & tablet experience

The Viva Connections mobile experience is aligned with the desktop experience and is exposing by default the same ACEs as configured for the desktop area, optimized for the mobile experiences.
