## New features and capabilities

### Partial Support for Teams JS SDK in Adaptive Card Extensions (Mobile only)

Developers can access **partial** Teams JS SDK in Adaptive Card Extensions via ACE's context (in the same way as in web parts).

```typescript
class AdaptiveCardExtensionContext {
  // ...
  public sdks: IPartialSDKs | undefined;cx
}

// Accessing the theme details using context
this.setState({
    theme: context.app.appInfo.theme
});
//...
```

> [!NOTE]
> Currently availability of this SDK is limited to Viva Connections Mobile only. We are working on introducing the support for this feature also for desktop and web site in future releases.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently we only provide access to the `theme` property of the `appInfo` object of the Teams' context for Adaptive Card Extensions.
