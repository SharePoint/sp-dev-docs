# Add a custom page and style to a SharePoint-hosted SharePoint Add-in

This is the seventh in a series of articles about the basics of developing SharePoint-hosted SharePoint Add-ins. You should first be familiar with [SharePoint Add-ins](sharepoint-add-ins.md) and the previous articles in this series, which you can find at [Get started creating SharePoint-hosted SharePoint Add-ins](get-started-creating-sharepoint-hosted-sharepoint-add-ins.md#Nextsteps). 
    
> [!NOTE]
> If you have been working through this series about SharePoint-hosted add-ins, you have a Visual Studio solution that you can use to continue with this topic. You can also download the repository at [SharePoint_SP-hosted_Add-Ins_Tutorials](https://github.com/OfficeDev/SharePoint_SP-hosted_Add-Ins_Tutorials) and open the BeforePage.sln file.

In this article, you add a help page to the Employee Orientation SharePoint Add-in and configure it to use a custom CSS stylesheet. 

## Add a page

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **Pages** folder and select **Add** > **New Item**. The **Add New Item** dialog opens to the **Office/SharePoint** node.

2. Select **Page** and give it the name **Help.aspx**. 

3. Find the two **asp:Content** elements in the file, and add the following third **asp:Content** markup in between them.
    
    ```HTML
      <asp:Content ContentPlaceHolderID="PlaceHolderPageTitleInTitleArea" runat="server">
        Help
      </asp:Content> 
    ```

4. Find the **asp:Content** element with the ID of **PlaceholderAdditionalPageHead**, and add the following markup to it.
    
    ```HTML
      <link rel="Stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../Content/App.css" />
    ```

5. Find the **asp:Content** element with the ID of **PlaceHolderMain**, and remove any child elements in it.

6. Add the following as content to the same **asp:Content** element.
    
    ```HTML
      <H3>Having a problem with the add-in?</H3>
      <p>Call the help line for Fabrikam Add-ins:</p>
      <p>1-555-555-5555</p>
    ```

7. Save and close the file.

8. Open the Default.aspx file.

9. Find the **asp:Content** element with the ID of **PlaceHolderMain**, and then add the following markup to the end of it. 
    
    ```HTML
      <p><asp:HyperLink runat="server" NavigateUrl="JavaScript:window.location = _spPageContextInfo.webAbsoluteUrl + '/Pages/Help.aspx';" 
        Text="Get help for the Employee Orientation add-in" /></p>
    ```

10. Save and close the file.

## Add a style class to the stylesheet

1. In **Solution Explorer**, open the app.css file in the **Contents** folder, and then add the following line to the file.
    
    ```
      p {color: green;}
    ```

2. Save and close the file.

## Run and test the add-in

1. Use the F5 key to deploy and run your add-in. Visual Studio makes a temporary installation of the add-in on your test SharePoint site and immediately runs the add-in. 

2. When the add-in's default page opens, select the **Get help for the Employee Orientation add-in** link to open the **Help** page.
    
   Your custom page opens and the two lines that you put in `<p>` tags are green.

3. To end the debugging session, close the browser window or stop debugging in Visual Studio. Each time that you select F5, Visual Studio will retract the previous version of the add-in and install the latest one.

4. You will work with this add-in and Visual Studio solution in other articles, and it's a good practice to retract the add-in one last time when you are done working with it for a while. Right-click the project in **Solution Explorer** and select **Retract**.
