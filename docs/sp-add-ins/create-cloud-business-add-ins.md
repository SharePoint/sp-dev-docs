# Create cloud business add-ins
By using the Cloud Business Add-in template in Visual Studio, you can quickly and easily create line-of-business add-ins that are hosted on SharePoint for Office 365 or SharePoint 2013 and based on Visual Studio LightSwitch technologies. Users can download and run cloud business add-ins on desktop computers and most mobile devices.
 

 **Note**  The name "apps for SharePoint" is changing to "SharePoint Add-ins". During the transition, the documentation and the UI of some SharePoint products and Visual Studio tools might still use the term "apps for SharePoint". For details, see  [New name for apps for Office and SharePoint](new-name-for-apps-for-sharepoint.md#bk_newname).
