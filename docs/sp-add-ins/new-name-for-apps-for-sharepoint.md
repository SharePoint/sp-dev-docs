# New name for apps for SharePoint

The name "apps for SharePoint" is changing to "SharePoint Add-ins." During the transition, the documentation and the UI of some SharePoint products and Visual Studio tools might still use the term "apps for SharePoint."

We are currently updating our products, documentation, samples, and other resources to reflect the platform name change from "apps for Office and SharePoint" to "Office and SharePoint Add-ins." We made this change to better distinguish the extension platform from Office Add-ins (applications). For your reference, the following table lists the names that are changing and the new names.

> [!NOTE]
> The name of the app launcher and the **My apps** page in Office 365 is not changing. The **My apps** page launches first-party apps and standalone web applications that authenticate using Azure Active Directory.
