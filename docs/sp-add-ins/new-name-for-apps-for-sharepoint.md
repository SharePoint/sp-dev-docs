# New name for apps for SharePoint

 **Note**  The name "apps for SharePoint" is changing to "SharePoint Add-ins". During the transition, the documentation and the UI of some SharePoint products and Visual Studio tools might still use the term "apps for SharePoint". For details, see  [New name for apps for Office and SharePoint](new-name-for-apps-for-sharepoint#bk_newname).
 

We are currently updating our products, documentation, samples, and other resources to reflect the platform name change from "apps for Office and SharePoint" to "Office and SharePoint Add-ins". We made this change to better distinguish the extension platform from Office Add-ins (applications). For your reference, the following table lists the names that are changing and the new names.

 **Note**  The name of the app launcher and the  **My apps** page in Office 365 is not changing. The **My apps** page launches first-party apps and standalone web applications that authenticate using Azure AD.
