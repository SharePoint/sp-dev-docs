# Tenancies and deployment scopes for SharePoint Add-ins

A SharePoint **tenancy** is a set of site collections in either a SharePoint farm or in SharePoint Online. In SharePoint Online, the site collections belong to a single customer account. In a SharePoint farm, the site collections can be all the site collections in a SharePoint web application or a subset of them, or it can be a set of site collections from across multiple web applications in the farm. A tenancy can have a SharePoint add-in catalog just as a SharePoint web application can.

## Tenancies and add-in scope

A SharePoint Add-in has an **add-in scope**. The two possible add-in scopes are web scope or tenant scope. The difference is not an intrinsic property of the add-in, and you, the developer, do not decide what the scope of your add-in is. The decision is made by tenant administrators as a side effect of how the add-in is installed. 

After an add-in is uploaded to the add-in catalog of a tenancy, it is immediately available to be installed on websites within the tenancy on a website-by-website basis. Add-ins that are installed this way have **web scope**. 

Tenant administrators have another option, however. They can choose to batch install the add-in to a subset of websites within the tenancy. Add-ins that are installed in this way have **tenant scope**. The tenant admin can specify which websites the add-in is installed to by means of a list of managed paths, a list of site templates, or a list of site collections. An add-in that has been batch-installed can only be uninstalled by a tenant administrator. When the tenant admin uninstalls the add-in, it is uninstalled from every website in the tenancy. Users can't uninstall a batch-installed add-in on a website-by-website basis. The same principle applies to updating a batch-installed add-in: only a tenant administrator can do it, and it is batch-updated on every website in the tenancy where it is installed.

If an add-in that includes an add-in web is batch-installed, only one add-in web is created, and it is shared by all the host websites on which the add-in is installed. The add-in web is located in the site collection of the organization's add-in catalog.

When new site collections are created in the tenancy, add-ins that were previously batch-installed are automatically installed on the new site collection.

> [!NOTE]
> Add-in scope should not be confused with Feature scope. Feature scope determines where the elements in a Feature are deployed. The possibilities include **Farm**, **WebApplication**, **Site** (that is, site collection), and **Web**. Only **Web** is permitted for Features in SharePoint Add-ins (both host web features and features inside a .wsp in an add-in package). 

> Add-in scope should also not be confused with add-in permission levels. SharePoint Add-ins can request permissions to all or selected parts of SharePoint content at the levels of list, web, site collection, and tenancy. Installing an add-in with tenant scope does not give it permissions that it would not otherwise have, nor does it cancel key provisions of the SharePoint security model. For more information about add-in permissions, see [Add-in permissions in SharePoint](add-in-permissions-in-sharepoint.md).

## Limitations of tenant-scoped add-ins

The following types of add-ins will not work correctly when batch-installed:

- Add-ins that contain a custom action for the ribbon (custom actions that are deployed as menu items are allowed)
- Add-ins that contain an add-in part

In addition, note again that installation with tenant scope is not possible in the Office 365 Small Business Premium version of SharePoint Online.

## How to install, uninstall, and update an add-in on multiple websites in a tenancy

Regardless of whether an add-in is installed from the Office Store or from an add-in catalog, tenant admins can install it to multiple websites in a tenancy, uninstall it, and update it by using the following procedures.

### To install a SharePoint Add-in to multiple websites

1. Go to the **Site Contents** page of the corporate catalog website.

2. Select **Add an add-in**, and install the add-in just as you would on any other SharePoint website.

3. After the add-in is installed, hover over the link to the add-in on the **Site Contents** page. A "**...**" link appears.

4. Select the link, and a callout appears.

5. Select **Deployment** on the menu.

6. Use the deployment UI that opens to specify the site collections to which you want the add-in installed. You can filter by managed paths, site templates, or URLs. The filters have a logical "OR" relationship: the add-in is installed to the union of all the site collections that pass any one or more of the filters.

7. Select **OK**.
    

### To uninstall a batch-installed SharePoint Add-in

1. Go to the **Site Contents** page of the corporate catalog website.

2. Hover over the link to the add-in on the **Site Contents** page. A "**...**" link appears.

3. Select the link, and a callout appears.

4. Select **Remove** on the callout.    
 

### To update a batch-installed SharePoint Add-in

1. Go to the **Site Contents** page of the corporate catalog website. If there is an update available for an add-in, a message appears next to the add-in. There will be a link to update the add-in.

2. Select the link to update the add-in.

3. When you are prompted to approve the permission requests of the add-in, select **Trust It**.
