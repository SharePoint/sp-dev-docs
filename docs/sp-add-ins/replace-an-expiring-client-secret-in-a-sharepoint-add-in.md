# Replace an expiring client secret in a SharePoint Add-in

[!INCLUDE [sp-add-in-deprecation](../../includes/snippets/sp-add-in-deprecation.md)]

Client secrets for SharePoint Add-ins that are registered by using the **AppRegNew.aspx** page expire after one year. This article explains how to add a new secret for the add-in, and how to create a new client secret that is valid for a customized date.

> [!NOTE]
> This article is about SharePoint Add-ins that are distributed through an organization catalog and registered with the **AppRegNew.aspx** page. If the add-in is registered on the Seller Dashboard, see [Create or update client IDs and secrets in the Seller Dashboard](/office/dev/store/create-or-update-client-ids-and-secrets).

## Recommended maintenance schedule

We recommend creating new secrets a minimum of 30 days before they expire. This gives you a month before the old credentials expire.

We recommend only removing secrets a minimum of 7 days after expiration, provided you have removed them from the application configuration.

Removing an expired secret from ACS before you remove it from the application configuration will cause errors.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following before you begin:

- You have installed Microsoft Graph Powershell SDK: [Install the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK](/powershell/microsoftgraph/installation)
- You're a tenant administrator (or having **Application.ReadWrite.All** permission) for the Microsoft 365 tenant where the add-in was registered with the **AppRegNew.aspx** page.

## Generate a new secret

1. Create a client ID variable with the following line, using the client ID of the SharePoint Add-in as the parameter:

    ```powershell
    $clientId = 'client id of the add-in'
    ```

1. Connect to Microsoft Graph with **Application.ReadWrite.All**, **Directory.ReadWrite.All** scope.

    ```powershell
    Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Application.ReadWrite.All,Directory.ReadWrite.All" # Login with corresponding scope. Should the tenant admin or anyone else have the permission.
    ```
    
1. Generate a new client secret with the following lines:

    ```powershell
    $appPrincipal = Get-MgServicePrincipal -Filter "AppId eq '$clientId'" # Get principal id by AppId
    $params = @{
        PasswordCredential = @{
            DisplayName = "NewSecret" # Replace with a friendly name.
        }
    }
    $result = Add-MgServicePrincipalPassword -ServicePrincipalId $appPrincipal.Id -BodyParameter $params    # Update the secret
    $base64Secret = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($result.SecretText)) # Convert to base64 string.
    $app = Get-MgServicePrincipal -ServicePrincipalId $appPrincipal.Id # get existing app information
    $existingKeyCredentials = $app.KeyCredentials # read existing credentials
    $dtStart = [System.DateTime]::Now # Start date
    $dtEnd = $dtStart.AddYears(2) # End date (equals to secret end date)
    $keyCredentials = @( # construct keys
        @{
            Type = "Symmetric"
            Usage = "Verify"
            Key = [System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes($result.SecretText)
            StartDateTime = $dtStart
            EndDateTIme = $dtEnd
        },
        @{
            type = "Symmetric"
            usage = "Sign"
            key = [System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes($result.SecretText)
            StartDateTime = $dtStart
            EndDateTIme = $dtEnd
        }
    ) + $existingKeyCredentials # combine with existing
    Update-MgServicePrincipal -ServicePrincipalId $appPrincipal.Id -KeyCredentials $keyCredentials # Update keys
    $base64Secret # Print base64 secret
    $result.EndDateTime # Print the end date.
    ```

1. The new client secret appears on the Windows PowerShell console. Copy it to a text file. You use it in the next procedure.

    > [!TIP]
    > By default, the secret lasts two years if you didn't specify the EndDateTime. You can customize by using the example below to specify the EndDateTime.
    > 
    > ```powershell
    > $params = @{
    >     PasswordCredential = @{
    >         DisplayName = "NewSecret" # Replace with a firendly name.
    >         EndDateTime = "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z" # Optional. Specify the end date you want. Using ISO 8601 format.
    >     }
    > }
    > ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Wait at least 24 hours for the propagation of the new ClientSecret to SharePoint.


## Update the remote web application in Visual Studio to use the new secret

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your add-in was created with a pre-release version of the Microsoft Office Developer Tools for Visual Studio, it may contain an out-of-date version of the **TokenHelper.[cs|vb]** file. If the file does not contain the string `secondaryClientSecret`, it is out of date and must be replaced before you can update the web application with a new secret. To obtain a copy of a release version of the file, you need Visual Studio 2012 or later. Create a new SharePoint Add-in project in Visual Studio. Copy the **TokenHelper.[cs|vb]** file from it to the web application project of your SharePoint Add-in.

1. Open the SharePoint Add-in project in Visual Studio, and open the **web.config** file for the web application project. In the `appSettings` section, there are keys for the client ID and client secret. The following is an example:

    ```xml
    <appSettings>
      <add key="ClientId" value="your client id here" />
      <add key="ClientSecret" value="your old secret here" />
      ... other settings may be here ...
    </appSettings>
    ```

1. Change the name of the `ClientSecret` key to `SecondaryClientSecret` as shown in the following example:

    ```xml
    <add key="SecondaryClientSecret" value="your old secret here" />
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are performing this procedure for the first time, there is no `SecondaryClientSecret` property entry at this point in the configuration file. However, if you are performing the procedure for a subsequent client secret expiration (second or third), the property `SecondaryClientSecret` is already present and contains the initial or already expired old secret. In this case, delete the `SecondaryClientSecret` property first before renaming `ClientSecret`.

1. Add a new `ClientSecret` key and give it your new client secret. Your markup should now look like the following:

    ```xml
    <appSettings>
      <add key="ClientId" value="your client id here" />
      <add key="ClientSecret" value="your new secret here" />
      <add key="SecondaryClientSecret" value="your old secret here" />
        ... other settings may be here ...
    </appSettings>
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You will not be able to use the newly generated client secret until the current client secret expires. Therefore, changing the `ClientId` key to the new client secret without the `SecondaryClientSecret` key present will not work. You must follow the  procedure in this article and wait for the previous client secret to expire. You can then remove the SecondaryClientSecret if you want to.

1. If you changed to a new **TokenHelper.[cs|vb]** file, rebuild the project.
1. Republish the web application.
