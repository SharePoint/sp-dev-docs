# Add first-run logic to the provider-hosted add-in
Learn how to include "first run" code in a provider-hosted SharePoint Add-in.
 

 **Note**  The name "apps for SharePoint" is changing to "SharePoint Add-ins". During the transition, the documentation and the UI of some SharePoint products and Visual Studio tools might still use the term "apps for SharePoint". For details, see  [New name for apps for Office and SharePoint](new-name-for-apps-for-sharepoint#bk_newname).
 

This is the eighth in a series of articles about the basics of developing provider-hosted SharePoint Add-ins. You should first be familiar with  [SharePoint Add-ins](sharepoint-add-ins) and the previous articles in this series:

 **Note**  If you have been working through this series about provider-hosted add-ins, then you have a Visual Studio solution that you can use to continue with this topic. You can also download the repository at  [SharePoint_Provider-hosted_Add-Ins_Tutorials](https://github.com/OfficeDev/SharePoint_Provider-hosted_Add-ins_Tutorials) and open the BeforeFirstRunLogic.sln file.
 

In this article you add code to the start page of the Chain Store SharePoint Add-in that checks to see if the current instance of the add-in is being run for the first time. If it is the first time, your code will deploy the  **Local Employees** list and the custom ribbon button.
 

## Create the basic class for deploying SharePoint components


 

 

 **Note**   The settings for Startup Projects in Visual Studio tend to revert to defaults whenever the solution is reopened. Always take these steps immediately after reopening the sample solution in this series of articles: Right-click the solution node at the top of **Solution Explorer** and select **Set startup projects**.  Make sure all three projects are set to **Start** in the **Action** column.
 


1. In the  **ChainStoreWeb** project in **Solution Explorer**, right-click the  **Utilities** folder and select **Add | Existing Item**.
    
 
2. In the  **File Explorer** that opens navigate to the solution folder, the **ChainStoreWeb** folder, and then open the **Utilities** folder.
    
 
3. Select SharePointComponentDeployer.cs and press  **Add**.
    
 
4. Open the file SharePointComponentDeployer.cs. It has a static class and two static methods that get and set the add-in's version in the  **Tenants** table of the corporate database. We won't discuss these methods because this series of articles is not intended to teach ASP.NET or SQL Server/Azure programming.
    
 
5. Add the following  **using** statements to the top of the file.
    
```
  using System.Web;
using System.Linq;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Microsoft.SharePoint.Client;
```

6. At the top of the  `SharePointComponentDeployer` class, add the following two static fields. Both of these will be initialized in the **Page_Load** method of the add-in's start page. You add that code in a later step. The first field will hold the **SharePointContext** object that is needed to make CRUD operations on SharePoint. The second will hold the version number of the add-in that is installed on the host web. This value will initially be different from the default value ( **0000.0000.0000.0000** ) that is recorded in the corporate **Tenants** table when the installation handler registers the tenant. For example, the first version of the add-in will be **1.0.0.0**.
    
```C#
  internal static SharePointContext sPContext;
internal static Version localVersion;
```

7. Create the following static property to hold the version of the add-in that is currently recorded in the corporate  **Tenants** table. It uses the two methods that were already in the file to get and set this value.
    
```C#
  internal static Version RemoteTenantVersion
{
    get
    {
        return GetTenantVersion();
    }
    set
    {
        SetTenantVersion(value);
    }
}
```

8. Now create the following  `IsDeployed` property. Note the following about this code:
    
      - The  **Page_Load** method of the add-in's start page will use the value of this property to determine whether or not the add-in is running for the first time. A **false** value signals that the add-in has not run before on the current host web, so its components need to be deployed.
    
 
  - The criterion is whether or not the version number registered in the  **Tenants** table is lower than the version actually installed. The first time the add-in runs, it will be lower. Code that you write in a later step sets the version in the **Tenants** table to the same version as is actually installed, so when the add-in runs again, `IsDeployed` will return **true** and the deployment logic will not execute again.
    
 

```C#
  public static bool IsDeployed
{
    get
    {
        if (RemoteTenantVersion < localVersion)
            return false; 
        else
            return true; 
    }
}
```

9. Add the following method to the  `SharePointComponentDeployer` class. Note that the last thing the method does is update the registered tenant version in the corporate database ( **0000.0000.0000.0000** ) to match the actual version of the add-in on the host web ( **1.0.0.0** ). You will complete this method in a later step.
    
```C#
  internal static void DeployChainStoreComponentsToHostWeb(HttpRequest request)
{
    // TODO4: Deployment code goes here.

    RemoteTenantVersion = localVersion;
}
```


 **Note**  You may wonder now why the add-in uses version numbers and a "less than" test to determine the answer to a simple yes/no question: is the add-in running for the first time? We could just as well have a simple string field in the  **Tenants** table that is set to "not run yet" in the installation handler, and then changed to "already run once" by the first-run logic after the SharePoint components are deployed.For the Chain Store add-in, a simple test would work. However, it is generally a good practice to use version numbers. This is because a production add-in is likely to be updated-in-place in the future; that is, updated after it is already installed. When that time comes, your add-in logic will need to be sensitive to more than the two possibilities not-yet-run andalready-run-once. Suppose, for example, that you want to add an additional list to the host web in the upgrade from version 1.0.0.0 to 2.0.0.0. You could do this in an update event handler, or in "first run after update" logic. Either way, your deployment logic will need to deploy new components, but it will also need to avoid trying to redeploy components that were deployed in a previous version of the add-in. A version number of 1.0.0.0 would signal that the components of version 1.0.0.0 have been deployed but that the first-run-after-update logic has not yet run.
 


## Add the basic startup logic


 

 

1. The SharePoint host web needs to tell the remote web application what version of the add-in it has installed. We'll use a query parameter to do this. Open the AppManifest.xml file in the  **ChainStore** project. In the designer you'll see the placeholder **{StandardTokens}** as the value of the **Query string** box. Add the string "&amp;SPAddInVersion=1.0.0.0" to the end. The manifest designer should look similar to the following.  *Notice that the version number you pass in the query string has to match the value in the  **Version** box of the designer.*  (If you ever update the add-in, one of your tasks is to raise these two values and keep them the same.)
    
  ![The General tab of the manifest designer. The Version box has the value one zero zero zero. The Query string box says "{StandardTokens}&amp;SPAddInVersion=1.0.0.0"](../../images/db71c411-10c5-43d8-bb5e-3388d2f6f7bc.PNG)
 

 

 
2. Open the CorporateDataViewer.aspx.cs file and add the following code to the  **Page_Load** method, just below the line that initializes the `spContext` object. Note the following about this code:
    
      - It begins by setting the two static fields in the static  `SharePointComponentDeployer` class. It passes the **SharePointContext** object because the code in the `SharePointComponentDeployer` will be calling into SharePoint, and it uses the query parameter that you added to set the `localVersion` property.
    
 
  - It does nothing if  `IsDeployed` is true; that is, if the "first run" logic has already run. Otherwise it calls the deployment method and passes the ASP.NET Request object.
    
 

```C#
  SharePointComponentDeployer.sPContext = spContext;
SharePointComponentDeployer.localVersion = new Version(Request.QueryString["SPAddInVersion"]);

if (!SharePointComponentDeployer.IsDeployed)
{
    SharePointComponentDeployer.DeployChainStoreComponentsToHostWeb(Request);
}
```


## Programmatically deploy a SharePoint list


 

 

1. In the SharePointComponentDeployer.cs file, replace the  `TODO4` with the following line. You create this method in the next step.
    
```C#
  CreateLocalEmployeesList();
```

2. Add the following method to the  `SharePointComponentDeployer` class. Note the following about this code:
    
      - It has two calls of  **ExecuteQuery**. The first is needed to determine if the list already exists. The second does the work of creating the list.
    
 
  - The  **ClientContext.LoadQuery** method is similar to the **ClientContext.Load** except that instead of bringing an entity, such as a list, down to the client, it brings down the enumerable results of a query.
    
 

```C#
  private static void CreateLocalEmployeesList()
{
    using (var clientContext = sPContext.CreateUserClientContextForSPHost())
    {
        var query = from list in clientContext.Web.Lists
                    where list.Title == "Local Employees"
                    select list;
        IEnumerable<List> matchingLists = clientContext.LoadQuery(query);
        clientContext.ExecuteQuery();

        if (matchingLists.Count() == 0)
        {
           // TODO5: Create the list 

           // TODO6: Rename the Title field on the list 

           // TODO7: Add "Added to Corporate DB" field to the list 

           clientContext.ExecuteQuery();
        }
    }
}
```

3. Replace  `TODO5` with the following code. Note the following about this code:
    
      - The  **ListCreationInformation** class is similar to the **ListItemCreationInformation** class you saw in an earlier article in this series. It is a lightweight class more suitable for sending information from the web application to SharePoint than the full **List** class.
    
 
  - There are many types of list templates, such as the Tasks type for a "to do" list and the Events type for a calendar. The  **Local Employees** list is based on the simplest: the Generic type.
    
 
  - The  **ListCreationInformation.Url** property holds the URL of the list *relative*  to the host web. By specifying "Lists/LocalEmployees", the code is setting the full URL of the list to https:// *{SharePointDomain}*  /hongkong/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/Lists/Local%20Employees.
    
 

```C#
  ListCreationInformation listInfo = new ListCreationInformation();
listInfo.Title = "Local Employees";
listInfo.TemplateType = (int)ListTemplateType.GenericList;
listInfo.Url = "Lists/Local Employees";
List localEmployeesList = clientContext.Web.Lists.Add(listInfo);
```

4. Replace  `TODO6` with the following code which changes the public name of the "Title" field (column) from "Title" to "Name". This is what you did on the **List Settings** page when you created the list manually.
    
```C#
  Field field = localEmployeesList.Fields.GetByInternalNameOrTitle("Title");
field.Title = "Name";
field.Update();
```

5. You also manually created a field named  **Added to Corporate DB**. To do that programmatically add the following code in place of  `TODO7`. Note the following about this code:
    
      - The key properties of the field are specified with an XML blob. This is a legacy of SharePoint's architecture: websites, lists, fields, content types, and most other kinds of SharePoint components are defined as XML. In this case we are specifying the display name, data type, and default value of the field.
    
 
  - The second parameter determines whether the field is visible in the default view of the list. We're setting it to  **true**. 
    
 
  - The third parameter can be used to determine what content types the field is added to. Passing  **DefaultValue** means that it is only added to the list's default content type.
    
 

```C#
  localEmployeesList.Fields.AddFieldAsXml("<Field DisplayName='Added to Corporate DB'"
                                         +"Type='Boolean'>"
                                         + "<Default>FALSE</Default></Field>",
                                         true,
                                         AddFieldOptions.DefaultValue);
```

6. Recall that the  **Added to Corporate DB** is **No** (that is, false) by default, but the custom ribbon button in the add-in sets it to **Yes** after it adds the employee to the corporate database. This system only works best if users cannot manually change the value of the field. To ensure that they don't, make the field invisible in the forms for creating and editing items on the **Local Employees** list. We do this by adding two more attributes to the first parameter, as shown in the following.
    
```C#
  localEmployeesList.Fields.AddFieldAsXml("<Field DisplayName='Added to Corporate DB'" 
                                         + " Type='Boolean'"  
                                         + " ShowInEditForm='FALSE' "
                                         + " ShowInNewForm='FALSE'>"
                                         + "<Default>FALSE</Default></Field>",
                                         true,
                                         AddFieldOptions.DefaultValue);
```


    The entire  `CreateLocalEmployeesList` should now look like the following.
    


```C#
  private static void CreateLocalEmployeesList()
{
    using (var clientContext = sPContext.CreateUserClientContextForSPHost())
    {
        var query = from list in clientContext.Web.Lists
                    where list.Title == "Local Employees"
                    select list;
        IEnumerable<List> matchingLists = clientContext.LoadQuery(query);
        clientContext.ExecuteQuery();

        if (matchingLists.Count() == 0)
        {
            ListCreationInformation listInfo = new ListCreationInformation();
            listInfo.Title = "Local Employees";
            listInfo.TemplateType = (int)ListTemplateType.GenericList;
            listInfo.Url = "LocalEmployees";
            List localEmployeesList = clientContext.Web.Lists.Add(listInfo);

            Field field = localEmployeesList.Fields.GetByInternalNameOrTitle("Title");
            field.Title = "Name";
            field.Update();

            localEmployeesList.Fields.AddFieldAsXml("<Field DisplayName='Added to Corporate DB'" 
                                                    + " Type='Boolean'"  
                                                   + " ShowInEditForm='FALSE' "
                                                   + " ShowInNewForm='FALSE'>"
                                                   + "<Default>FALSE</Default></Field>",
                                                    true,
                                                    AddFieldOptions.DefaultValue);
            clientContext.ExecuteQuery();
        }
    }
}
```


## Temporarily remove the custom button from the project

For technical reasons that we'll discuss in the next article, the custom button we created cannot be installed without modification when it is being put on the ribbon of a list that is programmatically deployed. We'll remove it temporarily from the project, so that we can test our first-run logic. We'll bring it back in the next article.
 

 
In  **Solution Explorer**, in the  **ChainStore** project, right-click the **AddEmployeeToCorpDB** node and select **Exclude from Project**.
 

 

## Request permission to manage lists on the host web

Since the add-in is now adding a list to the host web, not just items to an existing list, we need to escalate the permissions that the add-in requests from Write to Manage. Follow these steps.
 

 

1. In  **Solution Explorer**, open the AppManifest.xml file in the  **ChainStore** project.
    
 
2. Open the  **Permissions** tab and leave the **Scope** value at Web, but in the **Permission** field, select **Manage** from the drop down.
    
 
3. Save the file.
    
 

## Run the add-in and test the "first run" logic


 

 

1. Open the  **Site Contents** page of the Hong Kong store's website *and remove the  **Local Employees** list!* 
    
 
2. Use the F5 key to deploy and run your add-in. Visual Studio hosts the remote web application in IIS Express and hosts the SQL database in a SQL Express. It also makes a temporary installation of the add-in on your test SharePoint site and immediately runs the add-in. You are prompted to grant permissions to the add-in before its start page opens.
    
 
3. When the add-in's start page opens, select the  **Back to Site** link on the chrome control at the top.
    
 
4. Navigate to the  **Site Contents** page. The **Local Employees** list is present because your first-run logic added it.
    
     **Note**  If the list is not there or you have other indications that the first-run code is not executing, it may be that the  **Tenants** table is not being reverted to an empty state when you press F5. The most common cause of this is that the **ChainCorporateDB** project is no longer set as a startup project in Visual Studio. See the note near the top of this article for how to fix this. Also be sure that you've configured the database to be rebuilt as described in [Configure Visual Studio to rebuild the corporate database with each debugging session](give-your-provider-hosted-add-in-the-sharepoint-look-and-feel#Rebuild).
5. Open the list and add an item. Note that on the new item form, the  **Added to Corporate DB** field is no longer present, so it cannot be manually set. This is true of the edit item form as well.
    
  ![The new item form for the Local Employees list. The "Added to Corporate DB" field is no longer on the form. Only the name field and buttons for OK and Cancel.](../../images/3fdc6752-4184-4928-9423-0bc7c0206c62.PNG)
 

 

 
6. Use the browser's back button to navigate back to the add-in's start page.
    
 
7. Press the gear icon on the chrome control at the top, and select  **Account settings**.
    
 
8. On the  **Accounts** page, press the **Show Add-in Version** button. The version shows as **1.0.0.0** because the first-run logic changed it.
    
  ![The Account settings page with the version number of 1.0.0.0.](../../images/4c6d82a7-7c40-4190-b7e3-1337275e1e60.PNG)
 

 

 
9. To end the debugging session, close the browser window or stop debugging in Visual Studio. Each time that you press F5, Visual Studio will retract the previous version of the add-in and install the latest one.
    
 
10. You will work with this add-in and Visual Studio solution in other articles, and it's a good practice to retract the add-in one last time when you are done working with it for a while. Right-click the project in  **Solution Explorer** and choose **Retract**.
