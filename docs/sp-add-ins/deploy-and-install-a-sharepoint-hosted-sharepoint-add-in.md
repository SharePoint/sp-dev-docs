# Deploy and install a SharePoint-hosted SharePoint Add-in
Learn how SharePoint Add-ins are deployed and installed.
 

 **Note**  The name "apps for SharePoint" is changing to "SharePoint Add-ins". During the transition, the documentation and the UI of some SharePoint products and Visual Studio tools might still use the term "apps for SharePoint". For details, see  [New name for apps for Office and SharePoint](new-name-for-apps-for-sharepoint#bk_newname).
 

This is the second in a series of articles about the basics of developing SharePoint-hosted SharePoint Add-ins. You should first be familiar with the topic  [SharePoint Add-ins](sharepoint-add-ins) and the preceding topics in the series:

 **Note**  If you have been working through this series about SharePoint-hosted add-ins, then you have a Visual Studio solution that you can use to continue with this topic. You can also download the repository at  [SharePoint_SP-hosted_Add-Ins_Tutorials](https://github.com/OfficeDev/SharePoint_SP-hosted_Add-Ins_Tutorials) and open the BeforeColumns.sln file.
 

You'll find it a lot easier to develop SharePoint-hosted SharePoint Add-ins if you are familiar with how users deploy and install your add-ins. So, in this article, we'll take a brief break from coding to create and use an add-in catalog, and then install the add-in you've been working on.
 

## Create an add-in catalog


 

 

1. Login to your Office 365 subscription as an administrator. Choose the add-in launcher icon, and then choose the  **Admin** add-in.

2. In the  **Admin Center**, expand the  **Admin** node in the task pane and then choose **SharePoint**.
    
 
3. In the  **SharePoint Admin Center**, choose  **add-ins** in the task pane.
    
 
4. On the  **add-ins** page, choose **Add-in Catalog**. (If there is already an add-in catalog site collection in the subscription, it will open and you are done. You cannot create more than one add-in catalog in a subscription.)
    
 
5. On the  **Add-in Catalog Site** page, choose **OK** to accept the default option and create a new add-in catalog site.
    
 
6. On the  **Create Add-in Catalog Site Collection** dialog, specify the title and web site address of your add-in catalog site. We recommend that you include "catalog" in the title and URL to make it memorable and distinguishable in the **SharePoint Admin Center**.
    
 
7. Specify a  **Time Zone** and set yourself as the **Administrator**.
    
 
8. Set the  **Storage Quota** to the lowest possible value (currently 110, but that can change), because the add-in packages you upload to this site collection are very small.
    
 
9. Set the  **Server Resource Quota** to 0 (zero), and then choose **OK**. (The server resource quota is related to throttling poorly performing sandboxed solutions, but you won't be installing any sandboxed solutions on your add-in catalog site.)
    
 
As the site collection is being created, SharePoint takes you back to the  **SharePoint Admin Center**. After a few minutes, you'll see that the collection has been created.
 

## Package the add-in and upload it to the catalog


 

 

1. Open the Visual Studio solution, and then right-click the project node in  **Solution Explorer**. Choose  **Publish**.
    
 
2. In the  **Publish** pane, choose **Package the add-in**. The add-in is packaged and saved as an *.app file in the solution's \bin\debug\web.publish\1.0.0.0 folder.
    
 
3. Open your add-in catalog site in a browser and choose  **SharePoint Add-ins** in the navigation bar.
    
 
4. The  **SharePoint Add-ins** catalog is a standard SharePoint asset library. Upload the add-in package to it using any of the methods of uploading files to SharePoint libraries.
    
 

## Install the add-in as end users do


1. Navigate to any website in the SharePoint Online subscription and open the  **Site Contents** page.
    
 
2. Choose  **add an add-in** to open the **Your Add-ins** page.
    
 
3. Find the  **Employee Orientation** add-in in the **Add-ins you can add** section and click its tile.
    
 
4. Choose  **Trust It** on the consent dialog. The **Site Contents** page automatically opens and the add-in appears with a notation that it is installing. After it installs, users can choose the tile to run the add-in.
    
 

## Remove the add-in

In order to continue enhancing the same SharePoint Add-in in Visual Studio (see  [Next steps](#Nextsteps)), remove the add-in with these steps:
 

 

1. In the  **Site Contents** page, move the cursor over the add-in so that the callout button **...** appears.
    
 
2. Choose the callout button and then choose  **REMOVE** on the callout.
    
 
3. Navigate back to your add-in catalog site and choose  **SharePoint Add-ins** in the navigation bar.
    
 
4. Highlight the add-in and choose  **manage** on the task bar just above the list, and then choose **Delete** on the manage menu.

We strongly recommend that you continue with this series about SharePoint-hosted add-ins before you go on to the more advanced topics. Next we get back to coding in  [Add custom columns to a SharePoint-hostedSharePoint Add-in](add-custom-columns-to-a-sharepoint-hostedsharepoint-add-in).
