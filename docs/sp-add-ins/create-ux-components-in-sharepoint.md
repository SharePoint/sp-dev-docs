| [Use the client chrome control in SharePoint Add-ins](use-the-client-chrome-control-in-sharepoint-add-ins.md)|The chrome control in SharePoint enables you to use the header styling of a specific SharePoint site in your add-in without needing to register a server library or use a specific technology or tool. To use this functionality, you must register a SharePoint JavaScript library through a standard <script> tag. You can provide a placeholder by using an HTML **div** element and further customize the control by using the available options. The control inherits its appearance from the specified SharePoint website.|

The add-in webpage receives the custom property values through parameters in the query string.|

There are two types of custom actions available for add-ins: Ribbon and Edit Control Block.|

This mechanism enables you to use well-known technologies, such as HTML and JavaScript, to define the rendering logic of SharePoint list views. In client-side rendering, you can specify your own JavaScript resources and host them in the data storage options available to your add-ins, such as a document library.|
| [Use the client-side People Picker control in SharePoint-hosted SharePoint Add-ins](use-the-client-side-people-picker-control-in-sharepoint-hosted-sharepoint-add-ins.md)|Learn how to use the client-side People Picker control in SharePoint Add-ins.
