# Create a cloud business add-in
By using the Cloud Business Add-in template in Visual Studio, you can create SharePoint Add-ins 2013 or SharePoint on Office 365 that are optimized for adding and managing data.
 

 **Note**  The name "apps for SharePoint" is changing to "SharePoint Add-ins". During the transition, the documentation and the UI of some SharePoint products and Visual Studio tools might still use the term "apps for SharePoint". For details, see  [New name for apps for Office and SharePoint](new-name-for-apps-for-sharepoint#bk_newname).
 


 **Note**  You can also build a SharePoint Add-in by using the Add-in for SharePoint template.
