# Get to know the SharePoint REST service
Get the basics of using the SharePoint REST service to access and update SharePoint data, using the REST and OData web protocol standards.
 

 **Note**  The name "apps for SharePoint" is changing to "SharePoint Add-ins". During the transition, the documentation and the UI of some SharePoint products and Visual Studio tools might still use the term "apps for SharePoint". For details, see  [New name for apps for Office and SharePoint](new-name-for-apps-for-sharepoint.md#bk_newname).
 

SharePoint introduces a Representational State Transfer (REST) service that is comparable to the existing SharePoint  [client object models](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/88e5e1b9-eab2-4f3b-a3f2-75c96b86f1f4%28Office.15%29.aspx). Now, developers can interact remotely with SharePoint data by using any technology that supports REST web requests. This means that developers can perform  **Create**,  **Read**,  **Update**, and  **Delete** (CRUD) operations from their SharePoint Add-ins, solutions, and client applications, using REST web technologies and standard Open Data Protocol (OData) syntax.
 

## Prerequisites

This topic assumes you have a basic familiarity with REST and how to construct REST requests.
 

 

## How the SharePoint REST service works
<a name="bk_how"> </a>

SharePoint adds the ability for you to remotely interact with SharePoint sites by using REST. Now, you can interact directly with SharePoint objects by using any technology that supports standard REST capabilities.
 

 
To access SharePoint resources using REST, construct a RESTful HTTP request, using the Open Data Protocol (OData) standard, which corresponds to the desired client object model API. For example:
 

 
 *Client object model method:* 
 

 
List.GetByTitle(listname) 
 

 
 *REST endpoint:* 
 

 
 `http://server/site/_api/lists/getbytitle('listname')`
 

 
The client.svc web service in SharePoint handles the HTTP request, and serves the appropriate response in either Atom or JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. Your client application must then parse that response. The figure below shows a high-level view of the SharePoint REST architecture.
 

 

**SharePoint REST service architecture**

Because of the functionality and ease of use that client object models provide, they remain the primary development option for communicating with SharePoint sites by using .NET Framework managed code, Silverlight, or JavaScript.
 

 

### Use HTTP commands with the SharePoint REST service
<a name="bk_usingHTTP"> </a>

To use the REST capabilities that are built into SharePoint, you construct a RESTful HTTP request, using the OData standard, which corresponds to the client object model API you want to use. The client.svc web service handles the HTTP request and serves the appropriate response in either Atom or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. The client application must then parse that response.
 

 
The endpoints in the SharePoint REST service correspond to the types and members in the SharePoint client object models. By using HTTP requests, you can use these REST endpoints to perform typical CRUD operations against SharePoint entities, such as lists and sites. 
 

 
In general:
 

 


|**If you want to do this to an endpoint**|**Use this HTTP request**|**Keep in mind**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Read a resource|**GET**||
|Create or update a resource|**POST**|Use  **POST** to create entities such as lists and sites. The SharePoint REST service supports sending **POST** commands that include object definitions to endpoints that represent collections.For  **POST** operations, any properties that are not required are set to their default values. If you attempt to set a read-only property as part of a **POST** operation, the service returns an exception.|
|Update or insert a resource |**PUT**| Use **PUT** and **MERGE** operations to update existing SharePoint objects. Any service endpoint that represents an object property **set** operation supports both **PUT** requests and **MERGE** requests. For **MERGE** requests, setting properties is optional; any properties that you do not explicitly set retain their current property. For **PUT** requests, if you do not specify all required properties in object updates, the REST service returns an exception. In addition, any optional properties you do not explicitly set are set to their default properties.|
|Delete a resource|**DELETE**|Use the HTTP  **DELETE** command against the specific endpoint URL to delete the SharePoint object represented by that endpoint.In the case of recyclable objects, such as lists, files, and list items, this results in a  **Recycle** operation.|

### Construct REST URLs to access SharePoint resources
<a name="bk_constructURLs"> </a>

Whenever possible, the URI for these REST endpoints closely mimics the API signature of the resource in the SharePoint client object model. The main entry points for the REST service represent the site collection and site of the specified context. 
 

 
To access a specific site collection, use the following construction:
 

 
 `http://server/site/_api/site`
 

 
To access a specific site, use the following construction:
 

 
 `http://server/site/_api/web`
 

 
In each case,  *server*  represents the name of the server, and *site*  represents the name of, or path to, the specific site.
 

 
From this starting point, you can then construct more specific REST URIs by ''walking" the object model, using the names of the APIs from the client object model separated by a forward slash (/).
 

 
This syntax doesn't apply to the SocialFeedManager or SocialFollowingManager REST APIs. See  [Social feed REST API reference for SharePoint](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/f1cb914f-1e91-4e23-bf53-d2ab323eac13%28Office.15%29.aspx) and [Following people and content REST API reference for SharePoint](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c05755df-846d-4a39-941d-950d066cc6d4%28Office.15%29.aspx) for more information.
 

 
See  [Determine SharePoint REST service endpoint URIs](determine-sharepoint-rest-service-endpoint-uris.md) for more guidelines for determining SharePoint REST endpoint URIs from the signature of the corresponding client object model APIs.
 

 

## SharePoint REST endpoint examples
<a name="bk_URLexamples"> </a>

The following table contains typical REST endpoint URL examples to get you started working with SharePoint data. Prepend  `http://server/site/_api/` to the URL fragments shown in the table to construct a fully qualified REST URL. Where necessary for **POST** commands, the table contains sample data you must pass in the HTTP request body to create the specified SharePoint item. Items in italics represent variables that you must replace with your values.
 

 


|**Description**|**URL endpoint**|**HTTP method**|**Body content**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Retrieves the title of a list| `web/title`|GET|Not applicable|
|Retrieves all lists on a site| `lists`|GET|Not applicable|
|Retrieves a single 'list's metadata| `lists/getbytitle('listname')`|GET|Not applicable|
|Retrieves items within a list| `lists/getbytitle('listname')/items`|GET|Not applicable|
|Retrieves a specific property of a document. (In this case, the document title.)| `lists/getbytitle('listname')?select=Title`|GET|Not applicable|
|Creates a list| `lists`|POST|
```
{
  '__metadata':{'type':SP.List},
  'AllowContentTypes': true,
  'BaseTemplate': 104 ,
  'ContentTypesEnabled': true,
  'Description': 'My list description ',
  'Title': 'RestTest '
}
```

|Adds an item to a list| `lists/getbytitle('listname')/items`|POST|
```
{
  '__metadata':{'type': SP.Data.'listname'.ListItem},
  'Title': 'MyItem'
}

```

## Batch job support
<a name="batch"> </a>

The SharePoint Online (and on-premise SharePoint 2016 or later) REST service supports combining multiple requests into a single call to the service by using the OData  `$batch` query option. For details and links to code samples, see [Make batch requests with the REST APIs](make-batch-requests-with-the-rest-apis.md). .
