# Use the experimental People Picker widget in SharePoint Add-ins
Learn how to use the People Picker widget on any web page, even if the page is not hosted in SharePoint. Use the People Picker widget in your add-ins to help users find and select people and groups.
 

 **Note**  The name "apps for SharePoint" is changing to "SharePoint Add-ins". During the transition, the documentation and the UI of some SharePoint products and Visual Studio tools might still use the term "apps for SharePoint". For details, see  [New name for apps for Office and SharePoint](new-name-for-apps-for-sharepoint.md#bk_newname).
 


 **Caution**  The Office Web Widgets - Experimental are only provided for research and feedback purposes. Do not use in production scenarios. The Office Web Widgets behavior may change significantly in future releases. Read and review the  [Office Web Widgets - Experimental License Terms](office-web-widgetsexperimental-license-terms.md).
 


You can use the experimental People Picker widget in add-ins to help your users find and select people and groups in a tenant. Users can start typing in the text box and the widget retrieves the people whose name or e-mail matches the text.

Your add-in can access the selected people by reading the  **selectedItems** property of the widget. The selectedItems property is an array of objects that represent people or groups. The following table shows the available properties of the user object.
 


|**Property**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**department**|Represents the department of the user or group.|
|**displayName**|Represents the display name of the user or group.|
|**email**|Represents the e-mail address of the user or group.|
|**isResolved**|Indicates if the widget has successfully resolved the text in the widget against a user or group in the tenant.|
|**jobTitle**|Represents the job title of the user.|
|**loginName**|Represents the login name of the user or group.|
|**mobile**|Represents the mobile phone number of the user or group.|
|**principalId**|Represents the principal ID of the user or group.|
|**principalType**|Indicates if the item is a user or a group. It has a value of 1 if it's a user, 4 if it's a group.|
|**sipAddress**|Represents the sip address of the user or group.|
|**text**|Represents the text title of the user or group name.|
The People Picker widget has a cache of the most recently used (MRU) entries. The cache stores the five latest entries that the widget resolved.
 

## Prerequisites for using the examples in this article

To use the examples in this article, you need the following:
 

 

- Visual Studio 2013.
    
 
- NuGet Package Manager. For more information, see  [Installing NuGet](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=271465).
    
 
- A SharePoint development environment (app isolation required for on-premises scenarios).
    
 
- Office Web Widgets - Experimental NuGet package. For more information about how to install a NuGet package, see  [Managing NuGet Packages Using the Dialog](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/managing-nuget-packages-using-the-dialog). You can also browse the  [NuGet gallery page](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Office.WebWidgets.Experimental/).
    
 

## Use the People Picker widget in a provider-hosted SharePoint Add-in

In this example, there is a simple page hosted outside of SharePoint that declares a People Picker widget using markup. To keep things simple, this example doesn't declare any options, but you can see an example with options in the  [NextSteps](use-the-experimental-people-picker-widget-in-sharepoint-add-ins.md#NextSteps) section.
 

 
To use the People Picker widget, you must do the following:
 

 

- Create SharePoint Add-in and web projects.
    
 
- Create a module on the add-in web. This step ensures that an add-in web is created when users deploy the add-in.
    
     **Note**  The cross-domain library requires the existence of an add-in web. The People Picker widget communicates with SharePoint by using the cross-domain library.
- Create an add-in page that declares a People Picker widget instance using markup.
    
 

### To create a SharePoint Add-in and web projects


1. Open Visual Studio 2013 as administrator. (To do this, choose the Visual Studio 2013 icon on the  **Start** menu, and choose **Run as administrator**.)
    
 
2. Create a new project using the SharePoint Add-in 2013 template.The  **SharePoint Add-in 2013** template is located under **Templates**> **Visual C#**,  **Office/SharePoint**> **Add-ins**.
    
 
3. Provide the SharePoint website URL that you want to use for debugging.
    
 
4. Select  **Provider-hosted** as the hosting option for your add-in.
    
     **Note**  You can also use the People Picker widget with other hosting options or even with Office Add-ins or your own website.
5. Select  **ASP.NET Web Forms Application** as the type of web application project.
    
 
6. Select  **Windows Azure Access Control Service** as the authentication option.
    
 

### To create a module on the add-in web


1. Choose the SharePoint Add-in project in  **Solution Explorer**. Choose  **Add**> **New Item…**
    
 
2. Choose  **Visual C# Items**> **Office/SharePoint**> **Module**. Provide a name for your module.
    
     **Note**  If you're building a SharePoint-hosted add-in, you don't need to create an extra module.

### To add a new page that uses the People Picker widget


1. Choose the  **Pages** folder in the web project in **Solution Explorer**.
    
 
2. Copy the following code and paste it in an  **ASPX** file in the project. The code performs the following tasks:
    
      - Adds references to the required Office libraries and resources.
    
 
  - Initializes the controls runtime.
    
 
  - Runs the  **renderAll** method of the Office Controls runtime.
    
 
  - Declares a placeholder for the People Picker widget.

            }
        );

<script type="text/javascript">
    function createControl() {
        //Initialize Controls Runtime
        Office.Controls.Runtime.initialize({
            sharePointHostUrl: Office.Samples.PeoplePickerBasic.hostWebUrl,
            appWebUrl: Office.Samples.PeoplePickerBasic.appWebUrl
        });

        //Render the widget, this must be executed after the
        //placeholder DOM is loaded
        Office.Controls.Runtime.renderAll();
    }
</script>
</body>
</html>

```


 **Note**  The code example above explicitly specifies the host web and add-in web URLs to initialize the Office controls runtime. However, if the add-in web and host web URLs are specified in the  **SPAppWebUrl** and **SPHostUrl** query string parameters, respectively; you can pass an empty object and the code will attempt to get the parameters automatically. The **SPAppWebUrl** and **SPHostUrl** parameters are included in the query string when you use the **{StandardTokens}** token.
 

The following example shows you how to pass an empty object to the initialize method:
 

 



```
// Initialize with an empty object and the code 
// will attempt to get the tokens from the
// query string directly.
Office.Controls.Runtime.initialize({});
```


### To build and run the solution


1. Press the F5 key.
    
     **Note**  When you press F5, Visual Studio builds the solution, deploys the add-in, and opens the permissions page for the add-in.
2. Choose the  **Trust It** button.
    
 
3. Choose the add-in icon on the  **Site Contents** page.
    
 
You can also download this sample from code gallery, see the  [Use the People Picker experimental widget in an add-in](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/SharePoint-Use-the-57859f85) code sample.

<a name="NextSteps"> </a>

This article shows how to use the People Picker widget in your add-in by using HTML. You can also explore the following scenarios and details about the widget.
 

 

### Use JavaScript to declare the People Picker widget

Depending on your preference, you might want to use the JavaScript instead of HTML to declare the widget. If this is the case you can use the following markup as the placeholder for the widget.
 

 

```HTML
<div id="PeoplePickerDiv"></div>
```

Use the following JavaScript code to instantiate the People Picker.
 

 



```
new Office.Controls.PeoplePicker(
    document.getElementById("PeoplePickerDiv"), {});
```

For a code sample that shows how to perform the tasks, see the  **JSSimple.html** page in the [Use the People Picker experimental widget in an add-in](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/SharePoint-Use-the-57859f85) code sample.
 

 

### Specify options for the widget

You can specify options for the widget by using the  **data-office-options** attribute in the widget declaration. The following HTML shows how to specify options for the PeoplePicker widget.
 

 

```HTML
<div id="PeoplePickerDiv"
        data-office-control="Office.Controls.PeoplePicker"
        data-office-options='{
        "allowMultipleSelections" : true,
        "onChange" : handleChange,
        "placeholder" : "Check the count message, it changes when you add names..."
    }'>
</div>
```

The following code shows how to specify options when you declare the PeoplePicker widget using JavaScript.
 

 



```
new Office.Controls.PeoplePicker(
    document.getElementById("PeoplePickerDiv"), {
        allowMultipleSelections: true,
        placeholder: "Check the count message, it changes when you add names...",
        onChange: function (ctrl) {
            document.getElementById("count").textContent = 
ctrl.selectedItems.length.toString();
        }
    });
```

You can also specify event handlers for the  **onChange**, **onAdded**, and **onRemoved** events. Note in the code above that the event handler for the onChange event receives a single parameter **ctrl**, which is a reference to the widget.
 

 
For an example of how to specify options, see the  **MarkupOptions.html** and **JSOptions.html** pages in the [Use the People Picker experimental widget in an add-in](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/SharePoint-Use-the-57859f85) code sample.
 

 

### Retrieve the people or groups selected in the widget

To retrieve the people in the widget you must perform the following tasks:
 

 

- Get a reference to the widget.
    
 
- Access the  **selectedItems** property of the widget.
    
 
You can get a reference to the widget using the following syntax.
 

 



```
var pplPicker = document.getElementById("PeoplePickerDiv")._officeControl;
```

You can also save a reference when you instantiate the widget.
 

 



```
var pplPicker = new Office.Controls.PeoplePicker(
                        document.getElementById("PeoplePickerDiv"), {});
```

The  **selectedItems** property is an array of objects that represent people or groups. People or groups in the selectedItems array can either be resolved or unresolved, which you can check in the **isResolved** property. The following example shows how to access the element *i*  in the array and use the name of the person or group.
 

 



```
var principal = pplPicker.selectedItems[i];
$("#msg").text(principal.text + " is selected in the control.");
```

For an example of how to retrieve the selected people or groups from the widget, see the  **demo.html** page of the [Office Web Widgets - Experimental Demo](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/SharePoint-Office-Web-6d44aa9e) code sample.
 

 

### Customize the style of the widget

As a developer, you might want to customize the look &amp; feel of the widget. The following image shows the HTML hierarchy in the widget after it has been rendered.
 

 

**Figure 2. HTML hierarchy in the People Picker widget**

 

 
![HTML hierarchy in the People Picker control](../images/PeoplePicker_HTMLHierarchy.png)
 
The widget defines many classes prefixed by  **office-peoplepicker**, which you can find and customize in the **Office.Controls.css** style sheet.
 

 

## Conclusion
<a name="NextSteps"> </a>

You can use the experimental People Picker widget to select people and groups in your tenant, your add-in can then use the principals selected by your users. Please, provide ideas and comments in the  [Office Developer Platform UserVoice site](http://officespdev.uservoice.com/).
