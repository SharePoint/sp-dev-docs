# Design SharePoint Add-ins

Let's say you have a killer idea for an add-in. In this section, we'll guide you through the design decisions you need to make and offer best practices to build your add-in. For example, what makes a good user interface? What are the add-in "shapes" available? When should I use one instead of another? What options do I have for data access?

## Start designing SharePoint Add-ins

Because the Cloud Add-in Model in SharePoint makes so many design options possible, SharePoint Add-ins can come in many shapes and sizes. This section contains helpful guidance for some of the most important decisions that you need to make as you are planning and designing the architecture and user experience of your add-inâ€”including how you will host your add-in, how your add-in will efficiently and securely access data, and what the user experience will be.

## Design with update in mind

Someday you may want to produce an update of your add-in and upload it to the Office Store or an organization's add-in catalog. That task will be a lot easier if you think about how you would update the add-in while you are designing the first version. We recommend that you read the following articles early in the design phase.
