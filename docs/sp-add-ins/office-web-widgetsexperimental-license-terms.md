## MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS


### MICROSOFT OFFICE WEB WIDGETS

These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. Please read them. They apply to the software named above, which includes the media on which you received it, if any. The terms also apply to any Microsoft

- updates,

- supplements,

- Internet-based services, and

- support services

for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply.

**BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.**

**If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below.**

1. **INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.** You may install and use any number of copies of the software on your devices to design, develop and test your programs.
    
2. **SCOPE OF LICENSE.** The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not:
    
    - work around any technical limitations in the software;
    
    - reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation;
    
    - make more copies of the software than specified in this agreement or allowed by applicable law, despite this limitation;
    
    - publish the software for others to copy;
    
    - rent, lease, or lend the software; or
    
    - transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.
    
3. **BACKUP COPY.** You may make one backup copy of the software. You may use it only to reinstall the software.
    
4. **DOCUMENTATION.** Any person that has valid access to your computer or internal network may copy and use the documentation for your internal, reference purposes.
    
5. **EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.** The software is subject to United States export laws and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software. These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For additional information, see [www.microsoft.com/exporting](http://www.microsoft.com/exporting).
    
6. **SUPPORT SERVICES.** Because this software is "as is," we may not provide support services for it.
    
 
7. **FEEDBACK.** In the event that the Use Terms do not include a provision addressing Feedback, the following terms will apply.
    
    1. **Rights in Feedback.** Providing Feedback is voluntary. If a Feedback Provider provides Feedback to Microsoft, then the Feedback Provider grants to Microsoft, without charge, the non-exclusive license under Feedback Provider's owned or controlled Intellectual Property Rights, to make, use, modify, distribute, grant copyright and trade secret sublicense rights to, and otherwise commercialize such Feedback as part of any Microsoft Offering. The license granted to Feedback provided under this Agreement will survive termination of this Agreement or any Program.
    
    2. **Reservation of rights; ownership.** Subject only to the express licenses granted in this Agreement, the Feedback Provider:
    
        - Retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Feedback;
    
        - Reserves all rights not expressly granted; and
    
        - Limits the licenses granted under this Agreement to licenses under the Feedback Provider's owned or controlled Intellectual Property Rights in the Feedback. These licenses do not extend to any technologies that may also be necessary to make or use any Microsoft Offering, in whole or in part, that incorporates the Feedback, but are not themselves expressly part of the Feedback (e.g., enabling technologies).
    
    3. **Feedback not Confidential Information.** With respect to Feedback described in this Section 3 of this Agreement or in any other Program Documents:
    
        - Feedback is not confidential even if designated as confidential by the Feedback Provider; and

        - The Program Documents will govern.
    
 
8. **ENTIRE AGREEMENT.** This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.
    
9. **APPLICABLE LAW.**
    
    - **United States.** If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.
    
    - **Outside the United States.** If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.
    
 
10. **LEGAL EFFECT.** This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.
    
11. **DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.** THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED "AS-IS." YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
    
12. **LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES.** YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
    
    This limitation applies to

    - anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and

    - claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

    It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
