# Publish SharePoint Add-ins

You've finished developing your SharePoint Add-inâ€”the final step is to make it available to your users. You can do this by publishing the add-in to AppSource (formerly Office Store) and making it available within SharePoint.

- **AppSource** Publish your add-in to AppSource to make it publically available, so that it can be acquired by users of any SharePoint deployment.

- **An internal organization add-in catalog** Publish your add-in to an internal organization add-in catalog, hosted on your SharePoint deployment, to make it available to users who access that SharePoint deployment.

For information about how to package your add-in for publication by using Visual Studio 2012, see [Publish SharePoint Add-ins by using Visual Studio](publish-sharepoint-add-ins-by-using-visual-studio.md).

## Publishing to AppSource

To publish an add-in to AppSource, you must first [register as a Microsoft developer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/store/register). 

When you upload an add-in to AppSource for publication, there is an approval process that Microsoft performs. For example, it checks that the add-in is free of viruses, whether the add-in manifest markup is valid and complete and verifies that any SharePoint solution packages (.wsp files) that you included in the add-in do not contain elements that aren't allowed, or SharePoint features with a scope that is broader than web. The package is also inspected for objectionable content. If the add-in package passes verification, it's wrapped into a file and signed by Microsoft.

When you upload your add-in for publication on AppSource, you can choose the terms of the license you want to offer users when they download it. Use this add-in license to decide: 

- Whether you are offering your add-in for free, trial, or for purchase.
- Whether your add-in can be acquired on a per-user or site basis.

SharePoint does not enforce license terms for add-in usage. Instead, it provides a licensing framework that lets you include code logic in your add-in to enforce whatever licensing restrictions you choose. For example, you can include code logic in your add-in that enables users to access certain add-in features if they have a paid license, but not if they have a trial license. For more information, see [License your Office and SharePoint Add-ins](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/license-your-office-and-sharepoint-add-ins%28Office.15%29.aspx).

## Publishing to an add-in catalog

If you're creating SharePoint Add-ins for your own company's use or a specific corporate client, instead of the general public, you'll likely want to publish your add-in to an internal add-in catalog hosted on SharePoint. A private add-in catalog is a dedicated site collection in a SharePoint web application (or a SharePoint Online tenancy) that hosts document libraries for SharePoint Add-ins and Office Add-ins. Putting the catalog into its own site collection makes it easier for the web application administrator or tenant administrator to limit permissions to the catalog.

Uploading a SharePoint Add-in to a corporate add-in catalog is as easy as uploading any file to a SharePoint document library. You fill out a pop-up form in which you supply the local URL of the add-in package and other information, such as the name of the add-in. When you upload the add-in to an add-in catalog, there are similar checks, and add-ins that do not pass are marked as invalid or disabled in the catalog.

## Deciding where to publish your SharePoint Add-in

The following table offers a comparison of publishing to AppSource or to an add-in catalog, and lists issues to consider when deciding where to publish your add-in. We recommend you decide where you plan to publish your add-in before you design and develop it; in some cases, such as licensing, where you publish your add-in will affect the design and development of your add-in.

**Table 1. Considerations for where to publish your add-in**

|**AppSource**|**Add-in Catalog**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Add-in is publically available.|Add-in is available to users with access to this SharePoint deployment.|
|Licensing framework is available.|Licensing framework is not available for use.|
|Add-in package is verified by Microsoft for technical and content adherence to policies.|Add-in package verification is performed by SharePoint when add-in is uploaded.|
|You must be signed up with the Microsoft Seller Dashboard to upload add-ins.|No registration with Microsoft is required.|
