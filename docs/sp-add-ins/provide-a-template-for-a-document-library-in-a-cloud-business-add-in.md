# Provide a template for a document library in a cloud business add-in
In addition to the Office templates that are available when you add a document to a SharePoint document library, you can provide your own templates. For example, you might have your own sales quote template that you want to use when new orders are added.
 

 **Note**  The name "apps for SharePoint" is changing to "SharePoint Add-ins". During the transition, the documentation and the UI of some SharePoint products and Visual Studio tools might still use the term "apps for SharePoint". For details, see  [New name for apps for Office and SharePoint](new-name-for-apps-for-sharepoint.md#bk_newname).
 


## 

If you haven't already done so, associate a document library with your cloud business add-in. See  [Associate a document library with an entity](associate-a-document-library-with-an-entity.md).
 

 

### To add a template
