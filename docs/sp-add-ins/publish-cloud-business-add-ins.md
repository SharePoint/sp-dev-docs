# Publish cloud business add-ins

Cloud business add-ins can be published to SharePoint for Office 365 or to your own SharePoint site. After you publish your add-in, others can start it from SharePoint on their computers and mobile devices.

## Publish a provider hosted add-in

You can publish a cloud business add-in to SharePoint using the provider hosting option.

After your add-in is published to a SharePoint site, you can make it available in a local add-in catalog or in the SharePoint Store.
