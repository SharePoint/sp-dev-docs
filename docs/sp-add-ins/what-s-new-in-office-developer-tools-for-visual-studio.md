# What's new in Office Developer Tools for Visual Studio 2013
You can develop SharePoint Add-ins by using the following new features available in the Office Developer Tools for Visual Studio. 
 

 **Note**  The name "apps for SharePoint" is changing to "SharePoint Add-ins". During the transition, the documentation and the UI of some SharePoint products and Visual Studio tools might still use the term "apps for SharePoint". For details, see  [New name for apps for Office and SharePoint](new-name-for-apps-for-sharepoint.md#bk_newname).
 


 **Tip**  Download the latest version of the  [Office Developer Tools for Visual Studio 2013](http://aka.ms/OfficeDevToolsForVS2013).
