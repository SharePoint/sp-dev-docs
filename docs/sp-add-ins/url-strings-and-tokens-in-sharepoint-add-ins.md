# URL strings and tokens in SharePoint Add-ins

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For general information about constructing URLs in SharePoint and the use of tokens in those URLs, see [URLs and tokens in SharePoint](../general-development/urls-and-tokens-in-sharepoint.md). This topic describes the tokens that are available in SharePoint Add-ins.
 
SharePoint supports the tokens listed in the following tables for use in SharePoint Add-ins.

The tokens in the tables of this section can be used in URLs in a wide variety of situations in development of SharePoint Add-ins, such as in Custom Actions and in links on custom pages. 

In some contexts, some of these tokens cannot be used. Three of the most important places where only a restricted list of tokens can be used are the start page of an add-in, a custom action on the host web, and the **Src** property of an add-in part. These are called out in separate columns, *but this is not an exhaustive list of places where tokens can be used.*

In each table:
- The **StartPage** column specifies whether the token can be used in the **StartPage** element of an add-in manifest. 
- The **Custom Action** column specifies whether the token can be used in the URL of a custom action on a host web. 
- The **Add-in Part** column specifies whether the token can be used in the **Src** property of the add-in part.

## Tokens that you can use at the beginning of a URL

|**Token**|**Resolves to**|**StartPage**|**Custom Action**|**Add-in Part**|**Remarks**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|~appWebUrl|The URL of the add-in web of a SharePoint Add-in.|Yes|Yes|Yes|This token should be used only outside an add-in web. Within the add-in web itself, use **~site** for the URL of the add-in web.|
|~controlTemplates|The URL of the ControlTemplates virtual folder for the current website.|No|No|No||
|~hostUrl|The URL of the host web.|No|No|Yes||
|~hostLogoUrl|The URL of the logo of the host web.|No|No|No||
|~layouts|The URL of the Layouts virtual folder for the current website.|No|No|No||
|~remoteAppUrl|The URL of a remote web application in a SharePoint Add-in.|Yes|Yes, in the host web, but No in the add-in web.|Yes|If you are not using Microsoft Office Developer Tools for Visual Studio to develop your SharePoint Add-in, you cannot use **~remoteAppUrl** in the **StartPage** URL. However, when you are using Visual Studio and the tools, you can use this token for any provider-hosted add-in and it is resolved when Visual Studio packages the add-in. In this usage, it is really more of a Visual Studio token than a SharePoint token. It can be used outside the add-in manifest, even when you are not using Microsoft Office Developer Tools for Visual Studio.|
|~site|The URL of the current website.|No|No|Yes||
|~sitecollection|The URL of the parent site collection of the current website.|No|No|Yes||
Except where indicated otherwise, none of the tokens in the next table can be used in the  *path*  portion of the **Src** property value of the add-in part. The **Add-in Part** column refers to their use in the *query string*  portion of the value.
