# Set up a development environment for SharePoint Add-ins on Office 365

To get an understanding of your options before you carry out any procedures in this article, see [Tools and environments for developing SharePoint Add-ins](tools-and-environments-for-developing-sharepoint-add-ins.md). 

If you are not sure what kinds of SharePoint Add-ins you want to create, see [SharePoint Add-ins](sharepoint-add-ins.md).

## Install Visual Studio and tools on your computer

- If you don't already have **Visual Studio** 2013 or later installed, install it with the instructions at [Install Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio). We recommend using the [latest version from the Microsoft Download Center](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs).

- Visual Studio includes the  **Microsoft Office Developer Tools for Visual Studio**, but sometimes a version of the tools is released between updates of Visual Studio. To be sure that you have the latest version of the tools, run the [installer for Office Developer Tools for Visual Studio 2013](http://aka.ms/OfficeDevToolsForVS2013) or the [installer for Office Developer Tools for Visual Studio 2015](http://aka.ms/OfficeDevToolsForVS2015). 

### Verbose logging in Visual Studio

Follow these steps if you want to turn on verbose logging:

1. Open the registry, and go to **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\ _nn.n_\SharePointTools**, where _nn.n_ is the version of Visual Studio, such as 12.0 or 14.0.

2. Add a DWORD key named **EnableDiagnostics**.

3. Give the key the value **1**.

The registry path will change in future versions of Visual Studio.

## Sign up for an Office 365 Developer Site

> [!NOTE]
> You might already have access to an Office 365 Developer Site: 
> - **Are you an MSDN subscriber?** Visual Studio Enterprise with MSDN subscribers receive an Office 365 Developer Subscription as a benefit. [Redeem your benefit today.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/manage/default.aspx) 
> - **Do you have one of the following Office 365 subscription plans?** If so, an administrator of the Office 365 subscription can create a Developer Site by using the [Office 365 admin center](https://portal.microsoftonline.com/admin/default.aspx). For more information, see  [Create a developer site on an existing Office 365 subscription](create-a-developer-site-on-an-existing-office-365-subscription.md). 
 

There are three ways to get an Office 365 plan:

- Start with a [free 30-day trial](https://portal.microsoftonline.com/Signup/MainSignUp.aspx?OfferId=6881A1CB-F4EB-4db3-9F18-388898DAF510&amp;DL=DEVELOPERPACK) with one user license.

- Buy an [Office 365 developer subscription](https://portal.microsoftonline.com/Signup/MainSignUp.aspx?OfferId=C69E7747-2566-4897-8CBA-B998ED3BAB88&amp;DL=DEVELOPERPACK). 

- Sign up for a one-year Office 365 developer account through the Office 365 Developer Program. [Get more information](http://dev.office.com/devprogram), or go straight to [the sign-up form](https://profile.microsoft.com/RegSysProfileCenter/wizardnp.aspx?wizid=14b845d0-938c-45af-b061-f798fbb4d170). You'll get an email after you sign up for the developer program with a link to sign up for the developer account. Use the following instructions.

> [!TIP]
> Open these links in another window or tab to keep the following instructions handy.

1. The first page of the sign-up form is self-explanatory; supply the requested information, and then select **Next**.
    
2. On the second page, shown in Figure 1, specify a user ID for the administrator of the subscription.

   ![Page 2 of Sign up form for Office 365 account](../images/ff384c69-56bf-4ceb-81c3-8b874e2407f0.png) 

3. Create a subdomain of **.onmicrosoft.com**; for example, contoso.onmicrosoft.com. 
    
    After you sign up, you use the resulting credentials (in the format *UserID@yourdomain.onmicrosoft.com*) to sign in to your Office 365 portal site where you administer your account. Your SharePoint Online Developer Site is provisioned at your new domain: `http://yourdomain.sharepoint.com`.

4. Select **Next** and fill out the final page of the form. If you choose to provide a telephone number to get a confirmation code, you can provide a mobile or landline number, but *not* a VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) number.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you're signed in to another Microsoft account when you try to sign up for a developer account, you might see this message: "Sorry, that user ID you entered didn't work. It looks like it's not valid. Be sure you enter the user ID that your organization assigned to you. Your user ID usually looks like *someone@example.com* or *someone@example.onmicrosoft.com*." 
   
   > If you see that message, sign out of the Microsoft account you were using and try again. If you still get the message, clear your browser cache or switch to **InPrivate Browsing** and then fill out the form.

   After you finish the sign-up process, your browser opens the Office 365 installation page. Select the **Admin** icon to open the admin center page.

   *Figure 2. Office 365 admin center page*

5. Wait for your Developer Site to finish setting up. After provisioning is complete, refresh the admin center page in your browser.
    
6. Select the **Build Add-ins** link in the upper-left corner of the page to open your Developer Site. You should see a site that looks like the one in Figure 3. The **Add-ins in Testing** list on the page confirms that the website was made with the SharePoint Developer Site template. If you see a regular team site instead, wait a few minutes and then restart your site.
 
7. Make a note of the site's URL; it's used when you create SharePoint Add-ins projects in Visual Studio.
