# Get started developing cloud business add-ins
The best way to learn to develop a Cloud Business Add-in for SharePoint is to jump in and try it. The following tutorials and associate samples walk you through the process step-by-step. Go ahead - it's much easier than you might imagine.
 

 **Note**  The name "apps for SharePoint" is changing to "SharePoint Add-ins". During the transition, the documentation and the UI of some SharePoint products and Visual Studio tools might still use the term "apps for SharePoint". For details, see  [New name for apps for Office and SharePoint](new-name-for-apps-for-sharepoint.md#bk_newname).
 


 

## Incident Manager Tutorial

In this tutorial, you'll create an add-in for a fictional Contoso Fire Department to handle on-scene incident management. The walkthrough covers the core concepts of building a Cloud Business Add-in as well as more advanced concepts such as integrating SharePoint lists and document libraries. See  [Incident manager: A cloud business add-in tutorial](incident-manager-a-cloud-business-add-in-tutorial.md) for the tutorial topic and [Incident Manager: A Cloud Business Add-in Tutorial](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Incident-Manager-A-Cloud-c32d9b04) for the sample.
 

 

## Candidate Tracker Tutorial

In this walkthrough, you'll create an add-in to track job candidates, taking advantage of the SharePoint for Office 365 social integration feature to provide a newsfeed for the add-in. See  [Create a cloud business add-in with a social newsfeed](create-a-cloud-business-add-in-with-a-social-newsfeed.md) for the walkthrough topic and [Creating a Cloud Business Add-in with a Social Newsfeed](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Creating-a-Cloud-Business-8540c0c9) for the sample.
