# Customize a list view in SharePoint Add-ins using client-side rendering

In SharePoint, client-side rendering provides a way for you to produce your own output for a set of controls that are hosted on a SharePoint page. It enables you to use well-known technologies, such as HTML and JavaScript, to define the rendering logic of SharePoint list views. With client-side rendering, you can specify your own JavaScript resources and host them in the data storage options that are available to your add-ins, such as in a document library. A SharePoint-hosted add-in includes only SharePoint components. A SharePoint-hosted add-in has its resources in an isolated subsite of the host web, called the add-in web.

## Prerequisites for using the examples in this article

To follow the steps in this example, you need the following:

-  [Visual Studio 2015 and the latest Microsoft Office Developer Tools ](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/office-tools/)

- A SharePoint development environment (add-in isolation required for on-premises scenarios)

For guidance about how to set up a development environment that fits your needs, see [Two types of SharePoint Add-ins: SharePoint-hosted and provider-hosted](sharepoint-add-ins.md#two-types-of-sharepoint-add-ins-sharepoint-hosted-and-provider-hosted).

## Code example: Customize a list view by using client-side rendering

The following steps show you how to customize a list view that is deployed to the add-in web by using client-side rendering.

1. Create the SharePoint Add-in project.

2. Create a new list definition with a custom view.

3. Provide the custom rendering logic in a JavaScript file.

The following figure shows a client-side rendered view of an announcements list.

### To create the SharePoint Add-in project

1. Open Visual Studio 2015 as administrator. (To do this, right-click the **Visual Studio** icon on the **Start** menu, and select **Run as administrator**.)

2. Create a new project using the **SharePoint Add-in** template.
    
   The following figure shows the location of the **SharePoint Add-in** template in Visual Studio 2015, under **Templates** > **Visual C#** > **Office/SharePoint** > **Office Add-ins**.

3. Provide the URL of the SharePoint website that you want to use for debugging.
    
4. Select **SharePoint-hosted** as the hosting option for your add-in.

### To create a new list definition

1. Right-click the SharePoint Add-in project, and add a new **List** item. Create a customizable list based on Announcements.

2. Copy the following markup and paste it in the **Views** element in the Schema.xml file of your list feature. The markup performs the following tasks:
    
    - Declares a new view named Overridable with a BaseViewID=2.

    - Provides a value for the **JSLink** element that points to a JavaScript file that is provisioned with the add-in.
    
    > [!NOTE] 
    > The JSLink property is not supported on Survey or Events lists. A SharePoint calendar is an Events list.

    ```XML
    <View BaseViewID="2" 
        Name="8d2719f3-c3c3-415b-989d-33840d8e2ddb" 
        DisplayName="Overridable" 
        Type="HTML" 
        WebPartZoneID="Main" 
        SetupPath="pages\viewpage.aspx" 
        Url="Overridable.aspx"
        DefaultView="TRUE">
    <ViewFields>
        <FieldRef Name="Title" />
    </ViewFields>
    <Query />
    <Toolbar Type="Standard" />
    <XslLink>main.xsl</XslLink>
    <JSLink Default="TRUE">~site/Scripts/CSRListView.js</JSLink>
    </View>
    ```

<br/>

### To provide the custom rendering logic in a JavaScript file

1. Right-click the **Scripts** folder, and add a new JavaScript file. Name the file **CSRListView.js**.

2. Copy the following code and paste it in the CSRListView.js file. The code performs the following tasks:
    
    - Provides event handlers for the **PreRender** and **PostRender** events.

    - Provides templates for the Header, Footer, and Item template sets.

    - Registers the templates.

    ```js
    
    (function () {
        // Initialize the variable that stores the objects.
        var overrideCtx = {};
        overrideCtx.Templates = {};

        // Assign functions or plain html strings to the templateset objects:
        // header, footer and item.
        overrideCtx.Templates.Header = "<B><#=ctx.ListTitle#></B>" +
            "<hr><ul id='unorderedlist'>";

        // This template is assigned to the CustomItem function.
        overrideCtx.Templates.Item = customItem;
        overrideCtx.Templates.Footer = "</ul>";

        // Set the template to the:
        //  Custom list definition ID
        //  Base view ID
        overrideCtx.BaseViewID = 2;
        overrideCtx.ListTemplateType = 10057;

        // Assign a function to handle the
        // PreRender and PostRender events
        overrideCtx.OnPreRender = preRenderHandler;
        overrideCtx.OnPostRender = postRenderHandler;

        // Register the template overrides.
        SPClientTemplates.TemplateManager.RegisterTemplateOverrides(overrideCtx);
    })();

    // This function builds the output for the item template.
    // It uses the context object to access announcement data.
    function customItem(ctx) {

        // Build a listitem entry for every announcement in the list.
        var ret = "<li>" + ctx.CurrentItem.Title + "</li>";
        return ret;
    }

    // The preRenderHandler attends the OnPreRender event
    function preRenderHandler(ctx) {

        // Override the default title with user input.
        ctx.ListTitle = prompt("Type a title", ctx.ListTitle);
    }

    // The postRenderHandler attends the OnPostRender event
    function postRenderHandler(ctx) {

        // You can manipulate the DOM in the postRender event
        var ulObj;
        var i, j;

        ulObj = document.getElementById("unorderedlist");
        
        // Reverse order the list.
        for (i = 1; i < ulObj.children.length; i++) {
            var x = ulObj.children[i];
            for (j = 1; j < ulObj.children.length; j++) {
                var y = ulObj.children[j];
                if(x.innerText<y.innerText){                  
                    ulObj.insertBefore(y, x);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

### To build and run the solution

1. Select the F5 key.
    
    > [!NOTE] 
    > When you select F5, Visual Studio builds the solution, deploys the add-in, and opens the permissions page for the add-in.

2. Select the **Trust It** button.   
 
3. Go to your custom List by entering the  _/Lists/<your_list_instance>_ address relative to your add-in directory in the add-in web domain (not the host web domain). Add one or two announcements. On the ribbon, select the **Overridable** view.
