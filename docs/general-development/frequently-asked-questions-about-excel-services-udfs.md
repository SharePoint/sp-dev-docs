# Frequently Asked Questions About Excel Services UDFs

Here are some frequently asked questions about Excel Services user-defined functions (UDFs). 
  
    
    


## Creating Managed-Code UDFs


### What is a supported UDF class?

The UDF class in a UDF assembly must be public. It can be sealed. It cannot be abstract, internal, or private. It must have a parameterless, public constructor. For languages that automatically generate a parameterless, public constructor (for example, C#), you can have no constructor at all.
  
    
    

### What is a supported UDF method?

The UDF method in a UDF assembly must be public. The UDF method must be thread-safe.
  
    
    
A UDF method cannot have: 
  
    
    

- **ref** or **out** parameters
    
  
- **retval** attributes
    
  
- **Optional** arguments
    
  
- unsupported data types
    
  
The UDF method must also have a supported return type. For a list of supported data types, see the "Data Types" section of this topic.
  
    
    

### Can I call a Web service from a UDF assembly?

Yes. For an example, see the following UDF sample code. Also see  [How to: Create a UDF That Calls a Web Service](how-to-create-a-udf-that-calls-a-web-service.md).
  
    
    

```cs

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;
using Microsoft.Office.Excel.Server.Udf;
using UdfWS.dk.iter.webservices;

namespace UdfWS
{
    [UdfClass]
    public class MyUdfClass
    {
        // Instantiate the Web service. The Web service used is at   
        // http://webservices.iter.dk/calculator.asmx
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();

        [UdfMethod]
        public int MyFunction()
        {
            int i;
            i = (i + 88) * 2;
            return i;
        }

        [UdfMethod(IsVolatile = true)]
        public double MyDouble(double d)
        {
            return d * 9;
        }

        [UdfMethod]
        public int AddMe(int a, int b)
        {
            int c;
            // Call the Web service Add method
            c = calc.Add(a, b);
            return c;
        }        
    }
}
```


```VB.net

Imports System
Imports System.Collections.Generic
Imports System.Text
Imports Microsoft.Office.Excel.Server.Udf
Imports UdfWS.dk.iter.webservices

Namespace UdfWS
    <UdfClass> _
    Public Class MyUdfClass
        ' Instantiate the Web service. The Web service used is at   
        ' http://webservices.iter.dk/calculator.asmx
        Private calc As New Calculator()

        <UdfMethod> _
        Public Function MyFunction() As Integer
            Dim i As Integer
            i = (i + 88) * 2
            Return i
        End Function

        <UdfMethod(IsVolatile := True)> _
        Public Function MyDouble(ByVal d As Double) As Double
            Return d * 9
        End Function

        <UdfMethod> _
        Public Function AddMe(ByVal a As Integer, ByVal b As Integer) As Integer
            Dim c As Integer
            ' Call the Web service Add method
            c = calc.Add(a, b)
            Return c
        End Function
    End Class
End Namespace
```


## Data Types


### What are the data types that can be used as UDF parameters?

The supported data types are as follows:
  
    
    

- Numeric types: Double, Single, Int32, UInt32, Int16, UInt16, Byte, Sbyte
    
  
- String
    
  
- Boolean
    
  
- Object arrays: one- or two- dimensional arrays, that is, object [] and object [,]
    
  
- DateTime 
    
  

### What are the supported return value types?

The supported return value types are as follows:
  
    
    

- Numeric types: Double, Single, Int32, UInt32, Int16, UInt16, Byte, Sbyte
    
  
- String
    
  
- Boolean
    
  
- Object arrays: one- or two-dimensional arrays, that is, object [], object [,], int[] and int[,])
    
  
- DateTime 
    
  
- Object
    
  

## XLLs


### Are XLLs supported?

Not directly. Excel Services will load and call only managed-code UDFs. However, you can write a managed-code wrapper to call the XLLs and deploy the XLLs to the server, together with the managed-code wrapper assembly.
