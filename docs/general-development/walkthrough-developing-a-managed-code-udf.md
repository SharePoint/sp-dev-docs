# Walkthrough: Developing a Managed-Code UDF

This walkthrough describes the process for developing Excel Services user-defined functions (UDFs) using Microsoft Visual C#.

During this walkthrough, you will learn how to:
- Create a project using the Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 class library project template.
    
  
- Add a reference to Microsoft.Office.Excel.Server.Udf.dll.
    
  
- Write UDFs for use in Excel Services.
    
  
- Create a workbook to call custom functions from cells.
    
  
- Test and run UDFs in Excel Services.
    
  

## Prerequisites

In order to complete this walkthrough, you will need: 
  
    
    

- Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010 
    
    > [!NOTE] 
    > The easiest way to get all you need on the server is to do a basic, stand-alone install. All you need to add on top of that is a trusted location. 

- Excel
    
  
- Visual Studio or a similar Microsoft .NET Framework-compatible development tool
    
  
- To enable running the UDF assembly
    
  
- A trusted SharePoint document library in which to store a workbook, and to allow the workbook to call UDFs by setting the **AllowUdfs** value to **true**
    
  
- A sample workbook that calls the UDF stored in a trusted SharePoint document library
    
  
- Permissions to view and publish a workbook to a SharePoint document library
    
    > [!NOTE] 
    > For more information about setting permissions, see the Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 documentation. 

- To create the workbook using Excel
    
  
- To save the workbook as an .xlsx or .xlsb file
    
    > [!NOTE] 
    > For more information about how to trust a location, how to enable UDFs, and how to set the **AllowUdfs** flag, see [Step 3: Deploying and Enabling UDFs](step-3-deploying-and-enabling-udfs.md).
