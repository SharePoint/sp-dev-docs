# Language support for Windows Phone in SharePoint
Learn about language support for the Visual Studio templates that are installed by the SharePoint Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows Phone for mobile app development.
To develop your mobile application for more than one language, you need to globalize and localize the application. Most of the globalization and localization functionality that you need to implement is already built into the .NET Framework. By using this functionality, you can reach customers in many other countries and regions.
  
    
    

The Windows Phone SDK includes Visual Studio 2010 Express for Windows Phone, Windows Phone Emulator, XNA Game Studio, and Expression Blend. To get started, install the  [Windows Phone SDK 7.1](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27570) for Windows Phone development. Then install the [Microsoft SharePoint SDK for Windows Phone 7.1](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30476) to install the SharePoint templates for Windows Phone.
After you set up your development environment and install the SharePoint SDK for Windows Phone, see  [How to: Set up an environment for developing mobile apps for SharePoint](how-to-set-up-an-environment-for-developing-mobile-apps-for-sharepoint.md).
  
    
    

For more information about the SharePoint templates for Windows Phone, see  [Overview of Windows Phone SharePoint application templates in Visual Studio](overview-of-windows-phone-sharepoint-application-templates-in-visual-studio.md).
## Templates and libraries installed by the SharePoint SDK for Windows Phone

The SharePoint SDK for Windows Phone 7.1 installs the client object model (CSOM) libraries for Windows Phone, the SharePoint Auth library for Windows Phone, and the Windows Phone project templates, which you can use to build Windows Phone 7.1 applications against SharePoint or SharePoint 2010.
  
    
    
When you install the SharePoint SDK for Windows Phone, two additional Silverlight for Windows Phone templates are available for projects:
  
    
    

- Windows Phone Empty SharePoint Application
    
  
- Windows Phone SharePoint List Application
    
  

## Localized versions of the SharePoint SDK for Windows Phone
<a name="LanguageSupportForWindowsPhoneForSharePoint2013_LocalizedVersionsOfSharePointSDKForWindowsPhone"> </a>

Nine languages are supported by the SharePoint SDK for Windows Phone Developer Toolkit 7.1. Most of the work of creating an application is done at design time, including creating projects, designing forms, developing controls, and adding code. You can write Windows Phone applications by using any of the following localized versions of the SharePoint SDK for Windows Phone:
  
    
    

- English (en-US)
    
  
- French (fr-FR)
    
  
- German (de-DE)
    
  
- Italian (it-IT)
    
  
- Japanese (ja-JP)
    
  
- Korean (Ko-KR)
    
  
- Russian (ru-RU)
    
  
- Spanish (es-ES)
    
  
- Traditional Chinese (zh-TW)
    
  

## Supported localized languages for SharePoint Windows Phone applications
<a name="bk_supplocallangs"> </a>

When an application takes control, you interact with the application in the same way a user does. You can view code, run the application, and debug it, but you cannot change the code.
  
    
    
Although you have programmatic access to nine languages, you can run your SharePoint mobile applications in the twenty languages shown in Table 1.
