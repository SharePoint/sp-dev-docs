# Custom word breakers in SharePoint
Learn about word breaking in SharePoint. 
Word breaking is one of the key Natural Language Processing (NLP) features that enable search and improve search results (or recall). Word breakers split a stream of text into individual words or tokens on which you can base additional language processing. Word breakers are language-specific. In addition to built-in word breakers, Search in SharePoint enables the use of custom word breakers so that users can tune word breaking behavior according to their needs. See  [Supported languages for word breaker customizations in SharePoint](#SP15_SupportedLanguages) for a list languages supported for word breaker customization.

## How to switch to a custom word breaker in SharePoint
<a name="SP15wordbreaker_howto"> </a>


> **Caution:**
> When you replace existing word breakers, you modify the registry at your own risk. Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly by using Registry Editor or by using another method. These problems might require that you reinstall the operating system. Microsoft cannot ensure that these problems can be solved. Switching to a different word breaker might also cause serious problems during indexing and querying. Before you modify the registry, back up the registry and ensure that you know how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. 
  
    
    

Take the following steps to replace the existing word breaker with a custom word breaker or replace the existing word breaker with a word breaker in another language.
  
    
    

1. Open the Registry Editor, as follows:
    
1. Choose **Start**, and then choose **Run**.
    
  
2. In the **Open** dialog box, type **Regedit**, and then choose **OK**.
    
  
2. In Registry Editor, select the following registry subkey:
    
    **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Office Server\\15.0\\Search\\Setup\\ContentIndexCommon\\LanguageResources\\Default\\** _language from the list below_
    
  
3. In the right pane, open the shortcut menu for the **WBDLLPathOverride** registry value, and then choose **Modify**.
    
  
4. In the **Edit String** dialog box, in the **Value data** box, type the path to your custom word breaker DLL, and then choose **OK**. The new DLL should be located in the same path as the existing DLL that is being replaced.
    
  
5. In the right pane, open the shortcut menu for the **WBreakerClass** registry value, and then choose **Modify**.
    
  
6. In the **Edit String** dialog box, in the **Value data** box, type the class ID of your custom word breaker, and then choose **OK**.
    
  
7. Restart the SharePoint Search Host Controller and SharePoint.
