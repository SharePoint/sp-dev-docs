<a name="bkm_wfsamples"> </a>

This series of sample workflows was developed to demonstrate the large range of workflow capabilities in SharePoint 2013. They were developed using Visual Studio 2012 and are available in the  [MSDN Samples Gallery](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/). Links to the individual samples are provided.
  
    
    

### SharePoint 2013 workflow: Call an external web service

This sample uses Visual Studio to demonstrate creating a workflow that calls an external web service using the **HttpGet** activity. In calling the web service, the workflow also uses the new **DynamicValue** data type.
  
    
    
The sample, along with a readme file, is available here:  [SharePoint 2013 workflow: Call an external web service](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/SharePoint-workflow-48ea87d4)
  
    
    

### SharePoint 2013 workflow: Create a custom action

This sample uses Visual Studio to demonstrate creating a workflow that calls an external web service. In calling the web service, the workflow also uses the new **DynamicValue** data type. The part of the workflow that calls the web service and extracts the details from the response is contained within a custom activity, **GetNWCustomerDetailsWorkflow**.
  
    
    
The sample, along with a readme file, is available here:  [SharePoint 2013 workflow: Create a custom action](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/SharePoint-workflow-41e5c0f9)
  
    
    

### SharePoint 2013 workflow: Sales tax calculator

In this end-to-end sample, the workflow uses a web service to obtain the appropriate tax rate based on a purchaser's location, and then uses the base price to calculate the sales tax and total price.
  
    
    
The sample, along with a readme file, is available here:  [SharePoint 2013 workflow: Sales tax calculator](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/SharePoint-workflow-f7a1a8ba)

### SharePoint 2013 workflow: Workflow OM in a SharePoint app

The **SharePoint 2013 workflow: Workflow OM in a SharePoint app** code sample is an example of an interactive SharePoint-hosted app that uses the SharePoint workflow JSOM to deploy workflow definitions to both an app web and to a "parent web" (that is, a SharePoint web that is hosting the app).
  
    
    
You can locate the sample code here:  [SharePoint 2013 workflow: Workflow OM in a SharePoint app](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/SharePoint-workflow-050f5211).
