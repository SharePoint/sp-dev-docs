# How to: Save from Excel Client to the Server

This example shows you how to:
  
    
    


1. Create a workbook with editable ranges.
    
  
2. Save the workbook to a SharePoint document library that is a trusted location.
    
    > **Note:**
      > It is assumed that you have already created a SharePoint document library and made it a trusted location. For more information, see  [How to: Trust a Location](how-to-trust-a-location). 
3. Change values in a workbook by using the parameters pane in Excel Web Access.

### To create a workbook with ranges

2. In cell A1, type 8.
    
  
3. In cell A2, type =3*A1.
    
  
4. To make cell A1 editable in Excel Web Access, you must first make cell A1 into a named range: 
    
1. Click the **Formulas** tab, and then click cell **A1** to select it.
    
  
2. On the **Formulas** tab, in the **Defined Names** group, click **Define Name**.
    
  
3. In the **New Name** dialog box, in the **Name** text box, typeMyAOneParam.
    
  

### To save to Excel Services


1. On the **File** menu, click **Save &amp; Send**, and then click **Save to SharePoint**. 
    
  
2. In the **Save to SharePoint** dialog box, click **Publish Options**.
    
  
3. In the **Publish Options** dialog box, on the **Show** tab, ensure that **Entire Workbook** is selected.
    
  
4. On the **Parameters** tab, click **Add**..
    
  
5. In the **Add Parameters** list, select the **MyAOneParam** check box.
    
  
6. Click **OK**. You should now see "MyAOneParam" in the **Parameters** list.
    
  
7. Click **OK** to close the **Publish Options** dialog box.
    
  
8. In the **Save to SharePoint** dialog box, click **Save As**.
    
  
9. In the **Save As** dialog box, ensure that the **Open with Excel in the browser** check box is selected.
    
  
10. In the **File name** text box, type the path to the trusted SharePoint document library where you want to store this workbook. For example,http:// _MyServer002_/Shared%20Documents/TestParam.xlsx.
    
  
11. Click **Save**. You should see TestParam.xlsx in Excel Web Access. 
    
  

### To change values by using parameters


1. In the **Parameters** pane, you should see the named range for cell **A1**â€”that is, **MyAOneParam**. 
    
  
2. You can change the values in cell **A1** and cell **A2** by typing a number in the text box next to **MyAOneParam**. For example, if you type 10 and then click **Apply**, cell **A1** changes to **10** and cell **A2** changes to **30**.
