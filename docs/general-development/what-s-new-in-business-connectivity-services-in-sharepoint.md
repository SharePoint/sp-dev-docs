# What's new in Business Connectivity Services in SharePoint
Learn about changes and new features in Business Connectivity Services (BCS) for SharePoint, including enhanced support for REST, OData, external events, and app-scoped external content types.
Business Connectivity Services (BCS) was introduced in SharePoint 2010 as an improvement to the Business Data Catalog created for Office SharePoint Server 2007. BCS enables SharePoint to access data from external data systems such as SAP, ERP, and CRM, in addition to other data-driven applications that are exposed through Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) services or Open Data (OData) endpoints.
