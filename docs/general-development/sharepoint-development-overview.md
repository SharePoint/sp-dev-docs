# SharePoint development overview
SharePoint is a development platform for SharePoint Add-ins and farm solutions. Get acquainted with the capabilities and features of SharePoint to start your development.
## Introducing the SharePoint development platform
<a name="bk_introduction"> </a>

SharePoint is a versatile development platform for building add-ins and solutions with varying scopes that address a wide range of needs. The SharePoint developer documentation guides you through the features, technologies, capabilities, and models for development that distinguish SharePoint as a development platform. Our developer documentation walks you through the essentials of writing your first add-in, getting started working with the platform, and creating, using and interacting with SharePoint resources in your own code. We provide in-depth articles about SharePoint concepts, step-by-step how-to task guidance, and code samples to help you begin building SharePoint Add-ins and SharePoint solutions quickly and easily. 
  
    
    

## What kinds of development can you do with SharePoint?
<a name="bk_whatkinds"> </a>

Developers familiar with SharePoint know they can build server-side farm solutions that extend core SharePoint capabilities. SharePoint offers a new flexible development model—you can use SharePoint to create SharePoint Add-ins that take advantage of standard web technologies, such as JavaScript, OAuth, and OData. And SharePoint provides you with functionality to interact with SharePoint resources and a wide range of hosting options. The new SharePoint Add-in development model gives you the ability to build add-ins that take advantage of SharePoint capabilities and that run in the cloud instead of on your SharePoint farm. This flexible development model, along with the integration of standard web technologies, makes SharePoint development work more like other kinds of web development that you may already be doing.
