# Step 4: Building and Testing the Application

In this step, you will build and test your application. Visual Studio offers several methods to build and run a console application from the IDE, such as:
  
    
    


- Start Without Debugging ( **CTRL + F5**)
    
  
- Start ( **F5**)
    
  

## Build, Run, and Debug the Application


### To build and run the application


1. On the **Debug** menu, click **Start Without Debugging** or press **CTRL + F5**. This ensures that the console window remains open after the program has finished executing. 
    
  
2. The application prints the following output to the console.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > These values vary depending on the values you have in your workbook, session ID, and so on. 

    ```
    The Credential is: System.Net.SystemNetworkCredential
    Total rows in range: 18
    Value in range is: 4245.955129
    ```

3. Press any key to close SampleApplication.exe.
    
### File Not Found Exception


1. If the path to the workbook you provided is wrong, you will get a "file not found" exception, which is caught by the following code:
    
```cs
  
catch (SoapException e)
{
    Console.WriteLine("SOAP Exception Message: {0}", e.Message);
}
```


```VB.net
  
Catch e As SoapException
Console.WriteLine("SOAP Exception Message: {0}", e.Message)
End Try
```

2. The application prints the following SOAP exception output to the console:
    
```
  
SOAP Exception Message: The file you selected could not be found. Check the spelling of the file name and verify that the location is correct.

```


### Index Out Of Range Exception


1. If you try to get a value from outside the range, you will get a **System.IndexOutOfRangeException** exception. The application prints the following output to the console:
    
```
  
The Credential is: System.Net.SystemNetworkCredential
The sessionID is : 64.28e58e90-b757-4658-b1c4-890ad68ef6cbRmqR4IINXfkMeOJRG8Iq0Y
27tVk=110.33d3R6fqv7tr2jPyYiPwRu|!@en-US|en-US|+0480#0000-10-00-05T02:00:00:0000
#+0000#0000-04-00-01T02:00:00:0000#-0060
Total rows in range: 18
```

2. Then you will get an unhandled exception that says:
    
```
  
An unhandled exception of type 'System.IndexOutOfRangeException' occurred in SampleApplication.exe
Additional information: Index was outside the bounds of the array.
```

3. You can handle the above unhandled exception by adding another **catch** block to catch the exception after the SOAP exception **catch** block as shown here:
    
```cs
  
catch (Exception e)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Exception Message: {0}", e.Message);
}
```


```VB.net
  
Catch e As Exception
Console.WriteLine("Exception Message: {0}", e.Message)
End Try
```


### To run the application using F5


1. You can run your application by clicking **Start** on the **Debug** menu, or by pressing **F5**. To ensure that the console window remains open after the program has finished executing, you could add the following line of code at the end of your code (after the **catch** block):
    
```cs
  
Console.ReadLine();
```


```VB.net
  Console.ReadLine()
```

2. Press any key to close SampleApplication.exe.
