# Develop the site design in SharePoint 2013
Find links to information about using Design Manager and implementing a design for your SharePoint 2013 site.
If you want your SharePoint 2013 site to represent your organization's brand and not "look like SharePoint," you can create a custom design and use Design Manager to achieve that goal. Design Manager is a feature in SharePoint 2013 that makes it easier to create a fully customized, pixel-perfect design while using the web-design tools that you're already familiar with. Design Manager is a publishing feature that is available in publishing sites in both SharePoint Server 2013 and Office 365. You can also use Design Manager to brand the public-facing website in Office 365.
