# Develop the site design in SharePoint
Find links to information about using Design Manager and implementing a design for your SharePoint site.
If you want your SharePoint site to represent your organization's brand and not "look like SharePoint," you can create a custom design and use Design Manager to achieve that goal. Design Manager is a feature in SharePoint that makes it easier to create a fully customized, pixel-perfect design while using the web-design tools that you're already familiar with. Design Manager is a publishing feature that is available in publishing sites in both SharePoint and Office 365. You can also use Design Manager to brand the public-facing website in Office 365.
