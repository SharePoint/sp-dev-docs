# Overview of the SharePoint mobile object model
Learn about the new public classes in the SharePoint server object model and Silverlight client object model that are used to develop integrated solutions for SharePoint and Windows Phone 7.5.
## Client object model for mobile Silverlight
<a name="SP15OM_ClientOM"> </a>

All classes in this section are in the **Microsoft.SharePoint.Client** namespace. In addition to the APIs in this section, most of the classes and members in the section Server Object Model for SharePoint Mobility are also callable in the client object model. For classes that begin with "SP", the client object model name has the "SP" removed. In other cases, the client object model name is specified. Member names are the same in the client object model except where specified otherwise.
  
    
    

### AlternateUrl class

Represents an alternative URL for a web application and the zone to which it applies.
  
    
    

```cs

public class AlternateUrl
```


#### Properties

 **Uri** (read-only)
  
    
    
Gets the URI of the alternate URL.
  
    
    



```cs
public String Uri
```

 **UrlZone** (read-only)
  
    
    
Gets the zone of the alternate URL.
  
    
    



```
public UrlZone UrlZone
```

The UrlZone class is the client object model version of the SPUrlZone class in the server object model. For more information about it, see the  [SharePoint 2010 Software Development Kit (SDK)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee557253.aspx).
  
    
    

### AuthenticationCompletedEventArgs class

#### Methods

 **ClearAllApplicationSettings**
  
    
    
Clears all cookies, credentials, and UAG settings from the cache.
  
    
    



```cs
public static void ClearAllApplicationSettings
```

 **ClearAllCookies**
  
    
    
Clears all stored cookies and sets the **Status** property of all **Authenticator** objects to **NotStarted**.
  
    
    



```cs
public static void ClearAllCookies()
```

 **ClearAllCredentials**
  
    
    
Clears all credentials from the cache and sets the **Status** property of all **Authenticator** objects to **NotStarted**.
  
    
    



```cs
public static void ClearAllCredentials()
```

 **GetCredential**
  
    
    
Gets a credential object for the specified uri and authentication type.
  
    
    



```
public NetworkCredential GetCredential(Uri uri, string authType)
```

 **Parameters**
  
    
    

-  _uri_ is the URI, including port, for which the client is providing authentication.
    
  
-  _authType_ is the type of authentication requested.
    
  
This method is only used for anonymous authentication. If  _authType_ is not "Basic", an empty object is returned. For more information about the **NetworkCredential** class, see [NetworkCredential Class](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.networkcredential.aspx).
  
    
    
 **IsRequestUnauthorized**
  
    
    
Returns true if the authorization request failed because of an invalid cookie or credentials.
  
    
    



```cs
public static bool IsRequestUnauthorized(ClientRequestFailedEventArgs failedEventArgs)
```


#### Properties

 **AllowSmartRouting**
  
    
    
Gets or sets an indicator of whether smart routing is enabled.
  
    
    



```
public bool AllowSmartRouting
```

When smart routing is enabled, the **Authenticator** object tries to connect to the server that is running SharePoint and the UAG server and uses whichever responds first as its communication channel. If there is no UAG server, this property is ignored. The default is **true**. If set to **false**, the UAG server is always used.
  
    
    
 **AuthenticatorMode**
  
    
    
Gets or sets the authentication mode.
  
    
    



```cs
public ClientAuthenticationMode AuthenticationMode
```

For more information about the **ClientAuthenticationMode** enum, see later in this document.
  
    
    
 **CookieCachingEnabled**
  
    
    
Gets or sets an indicator of whether cookies are cached.
  
    
    



```
public bool CookieCachingEnabled
```

If you enable caching of cookies, consider that the cookies expire at some point. If they are expired when **ExecuteQueryAsync** is called, then it fails and the callback for failure runs. Accordingly, if you set this property to true, you must add code to the callback for failure that clears the cache if this happens. Here is an example, where `execQueryArgs` is of the type **ClientRequestFailedEventArgs** passed in the failure callback of **ExecuteQueryAsync**.
  
    
    



```cs
if (Authenticator.IsRequestUnauthorized(execQueryArgs))
{
    (sender as Authenticator).ClearCookies();
}
```

 **CredentialCachingEnabled**
  
    
    
Gets or sets an indicator of whether credentials are cached.
  
    
    



```cs

public bool CredentialCachingEnabled
```

 **Domain**
  
    
    
Gets or sets the domain or computer for the credential, usually this is the domain of the current user.
  
    
    



```cs
public string Domain
```

When this property is set to a new value, the **Status** property is set to NotStarted.
  
    
    
 **NavigateBackAfterAuthentication**
  
    
    
Gets or sets a indicator of whether the user should be navigated back to the previous page from the login page.
  
    
    



```cs
public bool NavigateBackAfterAuthentication
```

 **Password**
  
    
    
Gets or sets the password for the credential.
  
    
    



```cs
public string Password
```

When this property is set to a new value, the **Status** property is set to **NotStarted**.
  
    
    
 **PromptOnFailure**
  
    
    
Gets or sets an indicator of whether the user should be prompted to enter a name and password if initial authentication fails.
  
    
    



```cs
public bool PromptOnFailure
```

 **Status** (read-only)
  
    
    
Gets the status of the attempt to authenticate.
  
    
    



```cs
public AuthenticationStatus Status
```

See earlier in this document for information about the **AuthenticationStatus** class.
  
    
    
 **UagServerUrl**
  
    
    
Gets or sets the URL of the UAG server.
  
    
    



```cs
public Uri UagServerUrl
```

 **UserName**
  
    
    
Gets or sets the user name for the credential.
  
    
    



```cs
public string UserName
```

When this property is set to a new value, the **Status** property is set to **NotStarted**.
  
    
    

#### Events

 **AuthenticationCompleted**
  
    
    
Raised when the authentication attempt is completed, regardless of whether it succeeded.
  
    
    



```cs
public event EventHandler<AuthenticationCompletedEventArgs> AuthenticationCompleted;
```


### ClientAuthenticationMode enum

Specifies an authentication mode for an **Authenticator** object. This is an existing enum to which a new value, **BrowserBasedAuthentication** has been added.
  
    
    


|**Default**||
|:-----|:-----|
|**FormsAuthentication** <br/> |Represents forms-based authentication mode  <br/> |
|**Anonymous** <br/> |Represents anonymous access mode  <br/> |
|**BrowserBasedAuthentication** <br/> |Represents Microsoft Office Forms Based Authentication (MSOFBA) mode  <br/> |
   

### ODataAuthenticator class

Provides methods for authenticating a user on a SharePoint website.
  
    
    

```cs
public class ODataAuthenticator : Authenticator
```


#### Constructors

The constructors are identical to the parent class constructors. For more information, see Authenticator Class earlier in this document.
  
    
    

#### Methods

 **Authenticate**
  
    
    
Authenticates a user to the specified website.
  
    
    



```cs
public new void Authenticate(Uri serverUrl)
```

The  `new` keyword is used because the parent class has an internal method of the same name.
  
    
    

#### Properties

 **CookieContainer** (read-only)
  
    
    
Gets a container with the cookies for requests to the website.
  
    
    



```cs
public new CookieContainer CookieContainer
```

The  `new` keyword is used because the parent class has an internal method of the same name.
  
    
    
 **ResolvedUrl** (read-only)
  
    
    
Gets the URL that is used for communication to the server that is running SharePoint when an **ODataAuthenticator** is being used. This may be the URL published on the UAG server or, if the **AllowSmartRouting** property is true, this may be the SharePoint intranet URL if it is reached first when the **Authenticate** method is called.
  
    
    



```cs
public Uri ResolvedUrl
```


### ServerSettings class

Provides a method for getting the Alternate URLs of the web application that contains a website.
  
    
    

```cs
public static class ServerSettings
```


#### Methods

 **GetAlternateUrls**
  
    
    
Gets the alternate URLs of the specified website.
  
    
    



```cs
public static ClientObjectList<AlternateUrl> GetAlternateUrls(ClientRuntimeContext context)
```

 **Parameters**
  
    
    
 _context_ is the an object that represents the current client context.
  
    
    
See earlier in this document for information about the **AlternateUrl** class.
  
    
    

## Server object model for SharePoint mobility
<a name="SP15OM_ServerOM"> </a>

All classes in this section are in the **Microsoft.SharePoint** namespace. Except where specified, these are all available also in the client object model. For classes that begin with "SP", the client object model name has the "SP" removed. In other cases, the client object model name is specified. Member names are the same in the client object model except where specified otherwise.
  
    
    

### GeolocationFieldControl class

(Not available in client object model.) 
  
    
    
Governs the rendering of **SPFieldGeolocation** fields. An object of this type is used as the value of the **FieldRenderingControl** property of a **SPFieldGeolocation** object.
  
    
    



```cs
public class GeolocationFieldControl : BaseFieldControl
```

In connection with this class, note also that there are two rendering templates, one for Display mode and one for New and Edit mode. They are defined in the file %SHAREPOINTROOT%\\TEMPLATE\\ControlTemplates\\DefaultTemplates.ascx.
  
    
    

#### Fields

The following are used to render the field in the New and Edit modes.
  
    
    

```cs
protected TextBox m_latitudeBox;
protected TextBox m_longitudeBox;
protected Label m_longitudeLabel;
protected Label m_latitudeLabel;
```

### SPFieldGeolocationValue class

Represents a location on the globe defined by longitude, latitude, and possibly altitude too.
  
    
    

```cs
public class SPFieldGeolocationValue : SPFieldGeographyValue
```


#### Constructors (overloaded)

Initializes a new instance of the **SPFieldGeolocationValue** class.
  
    
    

```cs
public SPFieldGeolocationValue()
public SPFieldGeolocationValue(string fieldValue)
public SPFieldGeolocationValue(double latitude, double longitude)
public SPFieldGeolocationValue(double latitude, double longitude, double altitude, double measure)

```

 **Parameters**
  
    
    

-  _fieldValue_ is a string in one of the following Well-Known Text (WKT) formats:
    
  - "Point( _longitude_ _latitude_)", where  _longitude_ and _latitude_ are strings of one or more numerals, optionally including one period (which is interpreted as a decimal point) and optionally beginning with a hyphen (which is interpreted as a negative sign).
    
  
  - "Point( _longitude_ _latitude_ _altitude_ _measure_)", where  _longitude_,  _latitude_,  _altitude_, and  _measure_ are strings of one or more numerals, optionally including one period (which is interpreted as a decimal point) and optionally beginning with a hyphen (which is interpreted as a negative sign).
    
  
-  _latitude_ is the latitude and must be between -90.0 and 90.0.
    
  
-  _longitude_ is the longitude and must be between -180.0 and 180.0.
    
  
-  _altitude_ is the altitude.
    
  
-  _measure_ is an alternate designation of the point. See the **Measure** property later in this section for more information.
    
  

#### Methods

 **ToString**
  
    
    
This override returns one of the following, depending on whether the **Altitude** or **Measure** properties have been assigned a non-null value.
  
    
    

- If neither Altitude nor Measure have been assigned a non-null value:
    
    "Point( _longitude_ _latitude_)", where  _longitude_ and _latitude_ are strings of one or more numerals, optionally including one period (which is interpreted as a decimal point) and optionally beginning with a hyphen (which is interpreted as a negative sign).
    
  
- Otherwise (at least one of **Altitude** or **Measure** have been assigned a non-null value):
    
    "Point(longitude latitude altitude measure)", where  _longitude_,  _latitude_,  _altitude_, and  _measure_ are strings of one or more numerals, optionally including one period (which is interpreted as a decimal point) and optionally beginning with a hyphen (which is interpreted as a negative sign). If either **Altitude** or **Measure** has not been assigned a non-null value, it is reported as "0" in the value of the **WellKnownText** property. The converse does not hold: if either **Altitude** or **Measure** is reported as 0, that might be because it was never assigned a non-null value, but it might be because it was assigned 0.
    
  



```cs

public override string ToString()
```

 **ToWellKnownText**
  
    
    
Wraps **ToString**.
  
    
    



```cs
public string ToWellKnownText()
```


#### Properties

 **Altitude**
  
    
    
Gets or sets the altitude of the location. Use of this property is optional and the assumed unit-of-measure (for example, meters) and zero-point (for example, sea level or center-of-the-earth) is user-defined.
  
    
    



```cs
public double Altitude
```

 **Latitude**
  
    
    
Gets or sets the latitude of the location.
  
    
    



```cs
public double Latitude
```

The value must be between -90.0 and 90.0.
  
    
    
 **Longitude**
  
    
    
Gets or sets the longitude of the location.
  
    
    



```cs
public double Longitude
```

The value must be between -180.0 and 180.0..
  
    
    
 **Measure**
  
    
    
Gets or sets a user-defined alternate designation of the location point. For example, if the point is along a highway with milestone markers, this property could be used to hold the number of the milestone that is nearest to the point. If the point is in a public camping area with numbered campsites, this property could be used to hold the number of the nearest campsite. The semantics of the property are entirely user-determined and its use is optional.
  
    
    



```cs
public double Measure
```


### SPFieldType enum

A new value has been added to this enum:
  
    
    

```cs
Geolocation
```


### SPPhoneNotificationContent class

A base class for classes that represent the content of a phone notification. Derived classes must declare one or more fields or properties to hold the content and must implement the **PreparePayload** method to transform the content into a byte array.
  
    
    

```cs
public abstract class SPPhoneNotificationContent
```


#### Methods

 **PreparePayload**
  
    
    
When implemented in a derived class, transforms the content into a Byte array that is sent over the wire to the notification service. There is no default implementation so a derived class must implement this method.
  
    
    



```cs
protected internal abstract byte[] PreparePayload();
```


#### Properties

 **NotificationType** (read-only)
  
    
    
Gets the type of notification (for example, tile or toast) for which the content is intended.
  
    
    



```cs
public SPPhoneNotificationType NotificationType

```

For information about the **SPPhoneNotificationType**, see later in this document.
  
    
    
 **SubscriberType** (read-only)
  
    
    
Gets the type of the subscriber's device, for example, a Windows Phone.
  
    
    



```cs

public SPPhoneNotificationSubscriberType SubscriberType
```

For information about the **SPPhoneNotificationSubscriberType**, see later in this document.
  
    
    

### SPPhoneNotificationResponse class

Represents the outcome of an attempt to send a notification.
  
    
    

```cs
public class SPPhoneNotificationResponse
```


#### Methods

 **Create**
  
    
    
Creates an **SPPhoneNotificationResponse** object.
  
    
    



```cs
public static SPPhoneNotificationResponse
Create(SPPhoneNotificationSubscriberType subscriberType, 
SPPhoneNotificationType notificationType, HttpWebResponse response)
```

 **Parameters**
  
    
    

-  _subscriberType_ is the device, such as Windows Phone 7.5.
