# Read and write to the social feed by using the .NET client object model in SharePoint

Create a console application that reads and writes to the social feed by using the SharePoint .NET client object model.

## Prerequisites for creating a console application that reads and writes to the social feed by using the SharePoint .NET client object model

The console application that you'll create retrieves a target user's feed and prints the root post from each thread in a numbered list. Then, it publishes a simple text reply to the selected thread. The same method ( [CreatePost](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Social.SocialFeedManager.CreatePost.aspx) ) is used to publish both posts and replies to the feed.

To create the console application, you'll need the following:

- SharePoint with My Site configured, with personal sites created for the current user and a target user, and with a few posts written by the target user
- Visual Studio 2012
- **Full Control** access permissions to the User Profile service application for the logged-on user

> [!NOTE]
> If you're not developing on the computer that is running SharePoint, get the  [SharePoint Client Components](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=35585) download that contains SharePoint client assemblies.

## Create the console application in Visual Studio 2012 and add references to client assemblies

1. On your development computer, open Visual Studio 2012.
1. On the menu bar, choose **File**, **New**, **Project**.
. In the **New Project** dialog box, choose **.NET Framework 4.5** from the drop-down list at the top of the dialog box.
1. From the **Templates** list, choose **Windows**, and then choose the **Console Application** template.
1. Name the project ReadWriteMySite, and then choose the **OK** button.
1. Add references to the client assemblies, as follows:

    1. In **Solution Explorer**, open the shortcut menu for the **ReadWriteMySite** project, and then choose **Add Reference**.
    1. In the **Reference Manager** dialog box, choose the following assemblies:

        - **Microsoft.SharePoint.Client**
        - **Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Runtime**
        - **Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.UserProfiles**

        If you are developing on the computer that is running SharePoint, the assemblies are in the **Extensions** category. Otherwise, browse to the location that has the client assemblies you downloaded (see [SharePoint Client Components](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=35585)).

1. In the Program.cs file, add the following `using` statements.

```csharp
using Microsoft.SharePoint.Client;
using Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Social;
```

## Retrieve the social feed for a target user by using the SharePoint .NET client object model

1. Declare variables for the server URL and target user's account credentials.

    ```csharp
    const string serverUrl = "http://serverName/";
    const string targetUser = "domainName\\userName";
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Remember to replace the  `http://serverName/` and `domainName\\userName` placeholder values before you run the code.

1. In the `Main()` method, initialize the SharePoint client context.

    ```csharp
    ClientContext clientContext = new ClientContext(serverUrl);
    ```

1. Create the [SocialFeedManager](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Social.SocialFeedManager.aspx) instance.

    ```csharp
    SocialFeedManager feedManager = new SocialFeedManager(clientContext);
    ```

1. Specify the parameters for the feed content that you want to retrieve.

    ```csharp
    SocialFeedOptions feedOptions = new SocialFeedOptions();
    feedOptions.MaxThreadCount = 10;
    ```

    The default options return the first 20 threads in the feed, sorted by last modified date.

1. Get the target user's feed.

    ```csharp
    ClientResult<SocialFeed> feed = feedManager.GetFeedFor(targetUser, feedOptions);
    clientContext.ExecuteQuery();
    ```

    [GetFeedFor](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Social.SocialFeedManager.GetFeedFor.aspx) returns a `ClientResult<T>` object that stores the collection of threads in its [Value]( https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ee543385.aspx ) property.

## Iterate through and read from the social feed by using the SharePoint .NET client object model

The following code iterates through the threads in the feed. It checks whether each thread has the  [CanReply](/previous-versions/office/sharepoint-csom/jj163554(v=office.15)) attribute and then gets the thread identifier and the text of the root post. The code also creates a dictionary to store the thread identifier (which is used to reply to a thread) and writes the text of the root post to the console.

```csharp
Dictionary<int, string> idDictionary = new Dictionary<int, string>();
for (int i = 0; i < feed.Value.Threads.Length; i++)
{
    SocialThread thread = feed.Value.Threads[i];
    string postText = thread.RootPost.Text;
    if (thread.Attributes.HasFlag(SocialThreadAttributes.CanReply))
    {
        idDictionary.Add(i, thread.Id);
        Console.WriteLine("\\t" + (i + 1) + ". " + postText);
    }
}
```

## Post a reply to the social feed by using the SharePoint .NET client object model

1. (UI-related only) Get the thread to reply to and prompt for the user's reply.

    ```csharp
    Console.Write("Which post number do you want to reply to?  ");
    string threadToReplyTo = "";
    int threadNumber = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine()) - 1;
    idDictionary.TryGetValue(threadNumber, out threadToReplyTo);
    Console.Write("Type your reply:  ");
    ```

1. Define the reply. The following code gets the reply's text from the console application.

    ```csharp
    SocialPostCreationData postCreationData = new SocialPostCreationData();
    postCreationData.ContentText = Console.ReadLine();
    ```

1. Publish the reply. The  _threadToReplyTo_ parameter represents of the thread's [Id](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Social.SocialThread.Id.aspx) property.

    ```csharp
    feedManager.CreatePost(threadToReplyTo, postCreationData);
    clientContext.ExecuteQuery();
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The  [CreatePost](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Social.SocialFeedManager.CreatePost.aspx) method is also used to publish a root post to the current user's feed by passing **null** for the first parameter.

1. (UI-related only) Exit the program.

    ```csharp
    Console.WriteLine("Your reply was published.");
    Console.ReadKey(false);
    ```

1. To test the console application, on the menu bar, choose **Debug**, **Start Debugging**.

## Code example: Retrieve a feed and reply to a post by using the SharePoint .NET client object model

The following example is the complete code from the Program.cs file.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using Microsoft.SharePoint.Client;
using Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Social;

namespace ReadWriteMySite
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {

            // Replace the following placeholder values with the target server running SharePoint and the
            // target thread owner.
            const string serverUrl = "http://serverName/";
            const string targetUser = "domainName\\userName";

            // Connect to the client context.
            ClientContext clientContext = new ClientContext(serverUrl);

            // Get the SocialFeedManager instance.
            SocialFeedManager feedManager = new SocialFeedManager(clientContext);

            // Specify the parameters for the feed content that you want to retrieve.
            SocialFeedOptions feedOptions = new SocialFeedOptions();
            feedOptions.MaxThreadCount = 10;

            // Get the target owner's feed (posts and activities) and then run the request on the server.
            ClientResult<SocialFeed> feed = feedManager.GetFeedFor(targetUser, feedOptions);
            clientContext.ExecuteQuery();

            // Create a dictionary to store the Id property of each thread. This code example stores
            // the ID so a user can select a thread to reply to from the console application.
            Dictionary<int, string> idDictionary = new Dictionary<int, string>();
            for (int i = 0; i < feed.Value.Threads.Length; i++)
            {
                SocialThread thread = feed.Value.Threads[i];

                // Keep only the threads that can be replied to.
                if (thread.Attributes.HasFlag(SocialThreadAttributes.CanReply))
                {
                    idDictionary.Add(i, thread.Id);

                    // Write out the text of the post.
                    Console.WriteLine("\\t" + (i + 1) + ". " + thread.RootPost.Text);
                }
            }
            Console.Write("Which post number do you want to reply to?  ");

            string threadToReplyTo = "";
            int threadNumber = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine()) - 1;
            idDictionary.TryGetValue(threadNumber, out threadToReplyTo);

            Console.Write("Type your reply:  ");

            // Define properties for the reply.
            SocialPostCreationData postCreationData = new SocialPostCreationData();
            postCreationData.ContentText = Console.ReadLine();

            // Post the reply and make the changes on the server.
            feedManager.CreatePost(threadToReplyTo, postCreationData);
            clientContext.ExecuteQuery();

            Console.WriteLine("Your reply was published.");
            Console.ReadKey(false);

            // TODO: Add error handling and input validation.
        }
    }
}
```
