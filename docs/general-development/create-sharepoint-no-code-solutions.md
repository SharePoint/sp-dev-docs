## What is a SharePoint Composite?
<a name="bk_whatiscomposite"> </a>

A SharePoint Composite is a no-code, do-it-yourself business solution that you can create quickly by assembling, connecting, and configuring the basic building blocks of functionality available in SharePoint and Office 2013. A SharePoint Composite combines data, documents, and business processes in a useful, productive way.
  
    
    
Think of a SharePoint Composite as a mashup — a web application that you can use to incorporate data quickly into a simple, visual, and interactive solution. And because it's built on the SharePoint platform, you get the breadth and depth of a SharePoint solution. A SharePoint Composite can be as simple as a custom webpage that uses a site list and several connected web parts to track mileage in a small business. Or, a SharePoint Composite can be as sophisticated as a corporate-wide absence reporting system that's connected to a Human Resource database by using Business Connectivity Services (BCS).
