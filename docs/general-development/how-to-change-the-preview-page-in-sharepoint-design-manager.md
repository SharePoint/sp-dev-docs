# How to: Change the preview page in SharePoint 2013 Design Manager
Learn how to set, create, and change the preview page in Design Manager in SharePoint 2013.
The preview page is the page of your site that you use to see how your design looks. You can set the preview page to be either a specific page within your site or a generic preview. If you choose the generic preview, you'll see your master page with only a placeholder for content. You'll also see a message in the banner that you're currently previewing the master page without any content. If you choose a specific page, you'll see the page content rendered with the master page and the appropriate page layout.
  
    
    

As you interact with the page, you might do something that causes SharePoint to move away from the preview. For example, if you select **Save** on the ribbon, SharePoint saves the page and then displays the live version of the page. (The live version of the page uses the live master page, not the master page that you are designing.) You can return to the preview page by choosing **Reset the preview**.
