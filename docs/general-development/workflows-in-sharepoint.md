# Workflows in SharePoint
Learn about the Workflow Manager Client 1.0 authoring framework and workflow scenarios for SharePoint.
SharePoint marks the introduction of Workflow Manager Client 1.0 as the new foundation for SharePoint workflows. Built on Windows Workflow Foundation 4, SharePoint workflows offer a new range of capabilities and enhancements. For an overview of the new flavor of workflows for SharePoint, see  [What's new in workflows for SharePoint](what-s-new-in-workflows-for-sharepoint.md).
  
    
    

For information about setting up Workflow Manager Client 1.0 and pairing it to function correctly with SharePoint, see  [Set up and configure SharePoint Workflow Manager](set-up-and-configure-sharepoint-workflow-manager.md).
