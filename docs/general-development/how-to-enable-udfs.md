# Enable UDFs

Each Excel Services trusted location in the Shared Services Provider (SSP) has an **AllowUdfs** flag.
  
> [!NOTE]
> The **AllowUdfs** flag is denoted by the **User-defined functions allowed** option on the Excel Services Trusted File Locations page.
  
    
    


The default **AllowUdfs** value is **false**. If the **AllowUdfs** value is set to **false** in a particular trusted location, the workbooks in that trusted location are not allowed to call UDFs.
  
    
    

In order to allow UDFs to be called from a specific trusted location, you set the **AllowUdfs** value to **true**.If the **AllowUdfs** value is **false** when a session is started on a workbook that has UDF calls in this trusted location, the UDF calls will fail. If you change the **AllowUdfs** value to **true** after a session has started, the UDF calls will also fail. This is because changes in the **AllowUdfs** flag take effect on the next session, after the configuration database has been updated.You can get around this by restarting the session—for example, by selecting **Reload Workbook** in Excel Web Access.
> **Caution:**
> If you choose to reset Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) instead, it will end all current sessions. 
  
    
    


## Enabling UDFs

To do the following steps, you need a computer that has Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010 installed.
  
    
    

### To enable UDFs


1. On the **Start** menu, click **All Programs**. 
    
  
2. Point to **Microsoft Office Server** and click **SharePoint Central Administration**. 
    
  
3. On the Quick Launch, click your Shared Services Provider (SSP) link—for example, "SharedServices1"—to view the Shared Services home page for that particular SSP.
    
  
4. Under **Excel Services Settings**, click **User-defined functions**. 
    
  
5. On the Excel Services User-Defined Functions page, click **Add User-Defined Function** to open the Excel Services Add User-Defined Function Assembly page.
    
  
6. In the **Assembly** box, type the path to the UDF assembly. For example,C:\\MyUdfFolder\\MyUdf.dll.
    
  
7. Under **Assembly Location**, click **Local file**.
    
    > [!NOTE]
  > The **Local file** option will be replaced with **File path** in future releases of Excel Services. If you see **File path**, select that instead.   
  
8. Under **Enable Assembly**, the **Assembly enabled** check box should be selected by default.
    
  
9. Click **OK**.
    
  

## Allowing UDF Calls


### To allow UDFs to be called from a workbook


1. Open the Excel Services Add Trusted File Location page (if you are adding a new trusted location) or Excel Services Edit Trusted File Location page (if you are editing an existing trusted location). 
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > For more information about trusting a location, see  [How to: Trust a Location](how-to-trust-a-location.md). 

2. Under **Allow User-Defined Functions**, select **User-defined functions allowed** to allow UDFs to be called from workbooks stored in this trusted location.
    
  
3. Click **OK**.
