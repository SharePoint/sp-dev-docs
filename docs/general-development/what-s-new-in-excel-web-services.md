# What's New in Excel Web Services

This topic lists the new types and members added to Excel Web Services.
  
    
    


## Excel Web Services Enhancements

Excel Web Services is expanded and enhanced in Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010. In SharePoint Server 2010, you can edit and save a workbook programmatically. In addition, the Excel Web Services now supports opening workbooks in edit sessions in SharePoint Server 2010. In this scenario, you can use code to edit a workbook at the same time that other users are co-authoring the workbook.
