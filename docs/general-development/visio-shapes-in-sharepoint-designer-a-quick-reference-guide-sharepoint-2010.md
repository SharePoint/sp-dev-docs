# Visio shapes in SharePoint Designer 2013: A quick reference guide (SharePoint 2010 Workflow platform)
You can create a workflow in Microsoft Visio Professional 2013 and then export it to Microsoft SharePoint Designer 2013. This guide identifies the Visio shapes that you use to create your workflow.Use this reference article only if you are working in SharePoint Designer 2013 but want to continue to use the SharePoint 2010 Workflow Platform.The shapes for the SharePoint 2010 Workflow Platform come in three stencils: **Actions - SharePoint 2010 Workflow**, **Conditions - SharePoint 2010 Workflow**, and **Terminators - SharePoint 2010 Workflow**.
## Workflow actions
<a name="section1"> </a>

Workflow actions are specific operations that workflow performs. Every workflow must contain at least one action.
  
    
    
The actions in this list are organized in categories based on their area of application in a workflow. For example, actions that affect the behavior of a list item are grouped under **List Actions**, and actions related to document sets are grouped under **Document Set Actions**. The categories for actions are:
  
    
    

-  [Core actions](visio-shapes-in-sharepoint-designer-a-quick-reference-guide-sharepoint-2010.md#section1a) These are the most commonly used actions in a workflow.
    
  
-  [Document set actions](visio-shapes-in-sharepoint-designer-a-quick-reference-guide-sharepoint-2010.md#section1e) Typically, these actions are used in workflows that are associated with a document library or the document content type.
    
  
-  [List actions](visio-shapes-in-sharepoint-designer-a-quick-reference-guide-sharepoint-2010.md#section1b) These actions perform operations on list items.
    
  
-  [Relational actions](visio-shapes-in-sharepoint-designer-a-quick-reference-guide-sharepoint-2010.md#section1d) The single action in this category looks up a user's manager and stores that information in a variable.
    
  
-  [Task actions](visio-shapes-in-sharepoint-designer-a-quick-reference-guide-sharepoint-2010.md#section1c) These actions are associated with approval, feedback, and form operations.
    
  

> **Important:**
> Most of the action shapes that you can insert into a SharePoint workflow in Visio require additional configuration when the workflow is imported into SharePoint Designer. In Visio, remember to use the comments feature of each action shape to specify the settings or configuration of the action. 
  
    
    


### Core actions
<a name="section1a"> </a>

These are the most commonly-used actions and can be used in any type of workflow or step.



|**Visio Action Shape**|**Corresponding action in SharePoint Designer**|**Action description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|![Add a comment](../images/spd15-addcomment-visio.JPG)|This Visio action is the same as the **Add a Comment** action in SharePoint Designer 2013 and appears as: <br/> ![Add comment](../images/spd15-addcomment-txt.JPG)  <br/>  **Note:** Comments remain visible when the workflow is exported to Visio.           |**Add a comment** <br/> Use this action to leave informative comments in the workflow designer for reference purposes. This is especially helpful when there are other users co-authoring the workflow. For example, if a variable in the current workflow doesn't have a user-friendly name, you use this action to add a comment to indicate what the variable does in the workflow.  <br/> |

The date can be a current date, specific date, or a lookup.  <br/> |
|![Do calculation](../images/spd15-docalc-visio.JPG)|This Visio action is the same as the **Do Calculation** action in SharePoint Designer 2013 and appears as: <br/> ![Do calculation](../images/spd15-docalc-txt.JPG)|**Do calculation** <br/> Use this action to perform a calculation, such as add, subtract, multiply, or divide two values, and stores the output value in a variable.  <br/> |

You can set the time in hours and minutes and add a current date, specific date or a lookup.  <br/> |
|![Set workflow status](../images/spd15-SetWFStatus-visio.JPG)| This Visio action is the same as the **Set Workflow Status** action in SharePoint Designer 2013 and appears as: <br/> ![Set workflow status](../images/spd15-SetWFStatus-txt.JPG) You cannot rename or delete a status value once it has been created. However, you do not have to use it. <br/>  A custom status is applicable to the current workflow only, and cannot be used in another workflow <br/>  A workflow cannot use custom status values that you define in the action if the action is used inside an impersonation step. <br/> |**Set workflow status** <br/> Use this action to set the status of the workflow. The default options are **Canceled**, **Approved**, and **Rejected**.  <br/> You can enter a new status value in the dropdown in the action. Once you enter a status value, the entry is automatically added to the dropdown list.  <br/> If the **Set Workflow Status** action is the last step in your workflow where you have also used a custom value, you can see your custom value in the **Status** column in the list upon workflow pausing or completion. <br/> |
|![Set workflow variable](../images/spd15-SetWFVar-visio.JPG)|This Visio action is the same as the **Set Workflow Variable** action in SharePoint Designer 2013 and appears as: <br/> ![Set workflow variable](../images/spd15-SetWFVar-txt.JPG)|**Set workflow variable** <br/> Use this action to set a workflow variable to a value.

## Workflow conditions
<a name="section2"> </a>

A workflow condition is a branching point in the workflow. The workflow condition compares the input to a specified value. If they match, the workflow follows one branch; if not, it follows the other branch.
  
    
    

> **Important:**
> Most of the condition shapes that you can insert into a SharePoint workflow in Visio require additional configuration when the workflow is imported into SharePoint Designer. In Visio, remember to use the comments feature of each condition shape to specify the decision criteria of the condition. 
  
    
    


### General conditions

## Workflow terminators
<a name="section3"> </a>

In Visio, each workflow must begin with a Start terminator (![Start](../images/spd15-WFStart-icon.JPG)) and end with a Stop terminator (![Stop](../images/spd15-WFStop-icon.JPG)). Only one of each type of terminator can be used in a given workflow. Terminators are necessary when you create a SharePoint workflow in Visio so that the workflow can pass validation and can be exported. Workflow terminators are not used in SharePoint Designer.
