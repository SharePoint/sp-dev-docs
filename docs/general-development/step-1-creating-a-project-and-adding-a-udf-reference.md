# Step 1: Creating a Project and Adding a UDF Reference

In this step, you will create a project and add a reference to Microsoft.Office.Excel.Server.Udf.dll. 
  
    
    


## Creating the Project

The following project uses Microsoft Visual Studio 2005.
  
    
    

> **Note:**
> Depending on which settings you use in the Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE), the process to create a project could be slightly different. 
  
    
    


### To create a project


1. Start Visual Studio.
    
  
2. On the **File** menu, point to **New**, and then click **Project**. The **New Project** dialog box appears.
    
  
3. In the **Project Type** pane, select **Visual C# Projects**.
    
  
4. In the **Templates** pane, click **Class Library**.
    
  
5. In the **Name** box, type **SampleUdf**.
    
  
6. In the **Location** box, type the path where you want to save your project, or click **Browse** to navigate to the folder.
    
  
7. Click **OK**. Your new project appears in **Solution Explorer**. You also will see that a file with the default name of Class1.cs has been added to your project.
    
  
8. You should see the following code in the Class1.cs file:
    
```cs
  
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;

namespace SampleUdf
{
    public class Class1
    {
    }
}
```


```VB.net
  
Imports System
Imports System.Collections.Generic
Imports System.Text

Namespace SampleUdf
Public Class Class1
End Class
End Namespace
```


## Adding a Reference

The following steps show how to locate Microsoft.Office.Excel.Server.Udf.dll and how to add a reference to it. 
  
    
    

### To add a reference


1. On the **Project** menu, click **Add Reference**.
    
  
2. In the **Add Reference** dialog box, on the **.NET** tab, select **Excel Services UDF Framework**.
    
    > **Note:**
      > You can also open the **Add Reference** dialog box in **Solution Explorer** by right-clicking **References** and selecting **Add Reference**. 
3. Click **OK**.
    
    > **Note:**
      > The previous steps assume that you are building the project on a computer that has Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010 installed. On the computer where you have installed SharePoint Server 2010, you can find a copy of Microsoft.Office.Excel.Server.Udf.dll at: > [drive:]\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\web server extensions\\14\\ISAPI
