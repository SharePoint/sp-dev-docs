### Coordination actions
<a name="bkm_CoreActions"> </a>

Coordination actions are used to invoke a workflow based on the SharePoint 2010 Workflow platform. For more information on Coordination actions, see  [Understanding Coordination actions in SharePoint Designer 2013](understanding-coordination-actions-in-sharepoint-designer)

These data sources are all the same.>  Variable names in 2013 cannot contain special characters such as '?' and '#'. If a 2010 workflow contains special characters then they will be converted to hexadecimal code in the 2013 workflow.          |
|Start a Site Workflow  <br/> |Starts a Site workflow based on the SharePoint 2010 Workflow platform..  <br/> **Note:**  The Start a list workflow has the following issues:>  The 'Assignments' type field cannot be used as a parameter when the 2010 workflow has a TaskProcess action in it.>  When multiple calls are made to the same 2010 workflow the result will be multiple data sources in the 2013 workflow lookup functionality. These data sources are all the same.>  Variable names in 2013 cannot contain special characters such as '?' and '#'.
