# SharePoint Server 2019 development platform

This article contains preliminary details around supported development capabilities in the SharePoint 2019.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> This list is still subject to change until actual official release of SharePoint 2019. This page will be updated accordingly when there are changes in the supportability statements.

**Supported capabilities**

* Modern and classic pages
* Modern sites - modern team and communication site
    * Classic sites are also supported

* SharePoint Framework extensions in modern experiences

Supported SharePoint Framework version for the SharePoint 2019 will be SharePoint Framework v1.4.1 (except Microsoft Graph APIs). SharePoint Framework Yeoman generator will be updated to have this option included in the version selection. 

> [!NOTE] 
> If you need to write SharePoint Framework components for SharePoint 2019 before Yeoman generator is updated, you can install SharePoint Framework 1.4.1 and use that as the generator for your SharePoint 2019 components. You should use the 'Online' option in this case, when the environment question is asked in the Yeoman solution flow.
