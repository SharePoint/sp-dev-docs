> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are no plans to change or upgrade the supported SharePoint Framework version for SharePoint 2019.

> [!NOTE]
> By a rule of a thumb, SharePoint Framework works with any JavaScript framework version. It's however important to evaluate and validate behavior of the chosen JavaScript framework in the used SharePoint User Interface. There are differences between the support of the different web technologies on classic and modern experiences. Some newer JavaScript framework can take advantage of capabilities which are not supported on the SharePoint 2019 platform.
