# Walkthrough: Developing Using the Content Editor Web Part

The walkthrough in this section describes the process for interacting with the ECMAScript (JavaScript, JScript) object model in Excel Services by using the Content Editor Web Part.
  
    
    

During this walkthrough, you will learn how to:
- Create a text file that contains JavaScript and save it as a text file to a trusted document library. 
    
  
- Add a Content Editor Web Part, and then feed the URL for the JavaScript text file to the Content Editor Web Part.
    
  
- Display and interact with a workbook by using the Excel Services Web Part that will call the JavaScript in Excel Services that you scripted.
