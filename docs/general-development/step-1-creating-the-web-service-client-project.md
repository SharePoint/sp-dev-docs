# Step 1: Creating the Web Service Client Project

For this walkthrough, you will create a new project and a simple console application that accesses Excel Web Services. This walkthrough assumes you are developing in Visual Studio. 
  
    
    


## Creating the Project

The following project uses Microsoft Visual Studio 2003.
  
    
    

> **Note:**
>  If you are using Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 or Microsoft Visual Studio 2008, the process to create a new project is slightly different depending on which settings you use in the Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE).
  
    
    


### To create a new project


1. Start Visual Studio.
    
  
2. On the **File** menu, point to **New**, and then click **Project**. The **New Project** dialog box appears.
    
  
3. In the **Project Type** pane, select **Visual C# Projects**.
    
  
4. In the **Templates** pane, click **Console Application**.
    
  
5. In the **Name** box, type **SampleApplication**.
    
  
6. In the **Location** box, enter the path where you want to save your project, or click **Browse** to navigate to the folder.
    
  
7. Click **OK**. Your newly created project appears in **Solution Explorer**. 
  
    
    
In **Solution Explorer**, a file with the default name of Class1.cs has been added to your project.
