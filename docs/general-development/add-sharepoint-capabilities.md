# Add SharePoint capabilities
Find overview and how-to information about adding SharePoint features and capabilities to custom apps.
## What are SharePoint capabilities in SharePoint?
<a name="bkmk_whatIs"> </a>

SharePoint capabilities represent the features that you work with on SharePoint sites, such as workflows, social feeds, and search. By adding SharePoint capabilities to your app, you can help users to do things better and more quickly.
  
    
    
You can add SharePoint capabilities to whatever kind of app you're developing: SharePoint Add-ins, solutions, sites, components, and mobile apps.
