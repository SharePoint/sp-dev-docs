# Trust a location

Workbooks that you want to access must be placed in a trusted location. If they are not, calls to open the workbooks will fail. This example shows you how to trust a location by using the SharePoint Central Administration page. 
  
    
    

You can also trust a location by using Windows PowerShell. For more information, see the Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010 IT Pro and administration documentation on  [TechNet](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee428287%28office.14%29.aspx). 


### To trust a location


1. On the **Start** menu, click **All Programs**. 
    
  
2. Point to **Microsoft SharePoint 2010 Products**, and then click **SharePoint 2010 Central Administration**. 
    
  
3. On the SharePoint 2010 Central Administration page, under **Application Management**, click **Manage service applications**.
    
  
4. On the Manage Service Application page, click **Excel Services Application**.
    
  
5. On the Manage Excel Services Application page, click **Trusted File Locations**. 
    
  
6. On the Excel Services Application Trusted File Locations page, click **Add Trusted File Location**. 
    
  
7. On the Excel Services Application Add Trusted File Location page, in the **Address** text box, type the location to save your workbookâ€”for example,http:// _MyServer002_/Shared%20Documents. 
    
  
8. Under **Location type**, click the appropriate location type. In this example, select **SharePoint Foundation**.
    
  
9. Under **Trust Children**, select **Children trusted** if you want to trust child libraries or directories.
    
  
10. Click **OK**.
