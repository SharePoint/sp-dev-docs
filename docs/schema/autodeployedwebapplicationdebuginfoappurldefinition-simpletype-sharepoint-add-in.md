# AutoDeployedWebApplicationDebugInfoAppUrlDefinition simpleType 

(SharePoint Add-in Manifest)

**Applies to**: SharePoint Add-ins | SharePoint Foundation 2013 | SharePoint Server 2013

The type for add-in URLs of an auto-deployed web application. If the add-in has multiple URLs, its value is a list of URLs separated by a semicolon or comma.

> [!NOTE] 
> The string `app` appears as part of or all of some element, attribute, and file names because SharePoint Add-ins were originally called "apps for SharePoint." To ensure backward compatibility, the schemas have not been changed.
