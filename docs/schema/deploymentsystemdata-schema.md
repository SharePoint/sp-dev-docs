# DeploymentSystemData schema

**Applies to**: SharePoint 2016 | SharePoint Foundation 2013 | SharePoint Online | SharePoint Server 2013

The DeploymentSystemData schema provides validation for the SystemData.xml file exported into the content migration package. The SystemData file collects a variety of low-level system data. It records the number and names of Manifest.xml files (in cases where the migration uses multiple manifests), and it also supports schema versioning. Additionally, it holds a list of system files that are required by SharePoint Foundation.

## DeploymentSystemData schema elements and types

The following table lists elements in the schema file DeploymentSystemData.xsd file.
