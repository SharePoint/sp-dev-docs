# Major CAML files

**Applies to:** SharePoint 2016 | SharePoint Foundation 2013 | SharePoint Online | SharePoint Server 2013
  
Many critical files in Microsoft SharePoint Foundation use [Collaborative Application Markup Language (CAML) schemas](collaborative-application-markup-language-caml-schemas.md) to define how data is displayed and how HTML is rendered. 
  
## CAML files

The following table describes the major schema files that use CAML schemas for data definition or HTML rendering, and specifies their locations under %ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\web server extensions\15\. 
  
> [!CAUTION]
> With the exception of `DocIcon.xml`, Microsoft does not support modifying any of the built-in files that are installed with SharePoint Foundation. In most cases, you can supplement or override the effects of these files with files of your own. For details about modifying the effect of any specific file, see the SDK's documentation of the extensibility area to which the file belongs.
