# AppPartConfigDefinition schema reference

**Applies to**: SharePoint Add-ins | SharePoint Foundation 2013 | SharePoint Server 2013

> [!NOTE] 
> The string `app` appears as part of or all of some element, attribute, and file names because SharePoint Add-ins were originally called "apps for SharePoint." To ensure backward compatibility, the schemas have not been changed.

The AppPartConfigDefinition schema specifies the XML that can be used in the configuration for an app part in SharePoint Add-ins.
