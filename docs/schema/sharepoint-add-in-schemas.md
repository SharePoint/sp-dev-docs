# SharePoint Add-in schemas

**Applies to**: SharePoint 2016 | SharePoint Foundation 2013 | SharePoint Online | SharePoint Server 2013

Document schemas that support SharePoint Add-ins, including the App Manifest schema.

- [Schema reference for manifests of SharePoint Add-ins](schema-reference-for-manifests-of-sharepoint-add-ins.md)

- [AppHostWebFeatures schema reference](apphostwebfeatures-schema-reference.md)

- [AppPartConfigDefinition schema reference](apppartconfigdefinition-schema-reference.md)

> [!NOTE] 
> The string `app` appears as part of or all of some element, attribute, and file names because SharePoint Add-ins were originally called "apps for SharePoint". To ensure backward compatibility, the schemas have not been changed.
