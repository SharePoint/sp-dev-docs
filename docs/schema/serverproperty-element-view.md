## Elements and attributes

The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.

### Attributes

|**Attribute**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**Default** <br/> |Optional **Text**. Renders the text assigned to this attribute if the value returned by a selection is an empty string (`""`).  <br/> |
|**HTMLEncode** <br/> |Optional **Boolean**. **TRUE** to convert embedded characters so that they are displayed as text in the browser. In other words, characters that could be confused with HTML tags are converted to entities.  <br/> |
|**Name** <br/> |Optional **Text**. Specifies the name of the server property.  <br/> |
|**Select** <br/> |Required **Text**. Specifies the name of the property to select.  <br/> |
|**ShowField** <br/> |Optional **Text**. The **ShowField** attribute can be set to the field name to display. By default, a hyperlinked text from the Title field of the record in the external list is displayed. But the **ShowField** attribute can be used to override that and display another field from the external list.  <br/> The following data types are allowed as targets of a **ShowField** attribute: **Text**, **Choice**, and **Counter**.  <br/> |
|**StripWS** <br/> |Optional **Boolean**. **TRUE** to remove white space from the beginning and end of the value returned by the element.  <br/> |
|**URLEncode** <br/> |Optional **Boolean**. **TRUE** to convert special characters, such as spaces, to quoted UTF-8 format (for example, `%c3%ab` for character `Ã«`).  <br/> |
|**URLEncodeAsURL** <br/> |Optional **Boolean**. Like **URLEncode**, but **TRUE** to specify that the string to encode is a path component of a URL so that forward slashes (`/`) are not encoded.  <br/> |
