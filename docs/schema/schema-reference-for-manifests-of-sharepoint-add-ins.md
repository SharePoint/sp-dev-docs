# Schema reference for manifests of SharePoint Add-ins

**Applies to**: SharePoint Add-ins | SharePoint Foundation 2013 | SharePoint Online | SharePoint Server 2013

> [!NOTE] 
> The string `app` appears as part of or all of some element, attribute, and file names because SharePoint Add-ins were originally called "apps for SharePoint." To ensure backward compatibility, the schemas have not been changed.

The Add-in Manifest schema specifies the XML that can be used in an appmanifest.xml file for a SharePoint Add-in.
