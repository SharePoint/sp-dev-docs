# AppHostWebFeatures schema reference

> [!NOTE] 
> The string `app` appears as part of or all of some element, attribute, and file names because SharePoint Add-ins were originally called "apps for SharePoint." To ensure backward compatibility, the schemas have not been changed.

The AppHostWebFeatures schema specifies the XML that can be used in features deployed to the host web in SharePoint Add-ins.

- [Schema map (AppHostWebFeatures)](schema-map-apphostwebfeatures.md)

- [Elements (AppHostWebFeatures)](elements-apphostwebfeatures.md)

- [Types (AppHostWebFeatures)](types-apphostwebfeatures.md)
