> [!IMPORTANT]
> This topic describes markup that was used in an obsolete method of rendering custom field type properties. It is provided solely to assist with the debugging of custom field type properties developed against earlier versions of SharePoint Foundation. For information about the recommended method, see [Custom Field Type Property Rendering](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/a959ad5b-6f3a-462c-80b9-e2d00bb0d62a%28Office.15%29.aspx).

## Example

The following example defines a property schema for a custom field type called **RegularExpressionMatch**. The schema declares a field that can be used by column creators when they create a column based on the field type. The purpose of the field is to enable a column creator to set a *different* regular expression for each column that is based on the **RegularExpressionMatch** field type. 
  
The **DisplayName** and an editable **Text** field appear in the **Additional Column Settings** section on the **New Site Column** page and the **Create Column** page. The **MaxLength** attribute sets the maximum length, in characters, of the regular expression, and **DisplaySize** sets the size of the field that holds the **MaxLength** attribute. Users can scroll within the field to see the rest of the regular expression if it is longer than what appears in the **DisplaySize** field. 
  
In the following code example, the **Default** element for the property is `^(\d{3})\d{3}-\d{4}$` because this pattern matches American telephone numbers, and in this example the developer knows that his field will most frequently be used to create columns that hold American telephone numbers. When users create a column that is based on a custom field type, and the **New Site Column** and **Create Column** pages initially open, this property value appears in a text box, where it can then be changed by the column creator. 

The following code example has been edited for clarity. 
  
```XML
<FieldType>
  <Field Name="TypeName">RegularExpressionMatch</Field>
  …
  <PropertySchema>
    <Fields>
      <Field Name="RegularExpression" 
             DisplayName="Regular Expression To Match" 
             MaxLength="500" 
             DisplaySize="100" 
             Type="Text">
        <Default>^(\d{3})\d{3}-\d{4}$</Default>
      </Field>
    </Fields>
  </PropertySchema>
  …
</FieldType>
```
