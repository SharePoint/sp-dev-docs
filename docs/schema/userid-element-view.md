```

## Elements and attributes

The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.

### Attributes

|**Attribute**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**AllowAnonymous** <br/> |Optional **Boolean**. **TRUE** to allow anonymous requests without displaying a dialog box to ask for the user's password.  <br/> |
   
### Child elements

None
   
### Parent elements

Numerous
   
### Occurrences

- Minimum: 0
- Maximum: Unbounded 
   
### Remarks

The **UserID** element can be used to compare the value of a field to the current user ID. If the request is anonymous, this element, by default, causes the server to force authentication, which means it must display a dialog box in the browser that asks for a password, or else it must initiate Windows NT challenge/response (NTLM). If a user has accounts on multiple subsites or Web applications, the user ID may be different in each case.
