## Elements and attributes

The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.

### Attributes

|**Attribute**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**Location** <br/> |Required **Text**. A path that is relative to %ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\web server extensions\15\.  <br/> |
   
### Child elements

None
   
### Parent elements

- [RootFiles](rootfiles-element-solution.md)
   
### Remarks

Use this element to deploy a localization resource that is shared by several features. Shared localization resources are located in the %ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\web server extensions\15\Resources folder. For example, the following XML deploys three shared localization resource files.
  
```XML
<RootFiles>
  <RootFile Location="Resources\wingtip.resx" />
  <RootFile Location="Resources\wingtip.en-US.resx" />
  <RootFile Location="Resources\wingtip.es-ES.resx" />
</RootFiles>

```

For more information about using shared localization resources, see the description of the **DefaultResourceFile** attribute in [Feature Element (Feature)](feature-element-feature.md).

<br/>

Localization resources used by extensions to the Central Administration user interface are located in the %ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\web server extensions\15\Config\AdminResources folder. The following XML deploys localization resource files to that folder.
  
```XML
<RootFiles>
  <RootFile Location="Config\AdminResources\wingtip.resx" />
  <RootFile Location="Config\AdminResources\wingtip.en-US.resx" />
  <RootFile Location="Config\AdminResources\wingtip.es-ES.resx" />
</RootFiles>

```
