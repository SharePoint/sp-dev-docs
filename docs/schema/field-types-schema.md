# Field Types schema

**Applies to:** SharePoint 2016 | SharePoint Foundation 2013 | SharePoint Online | SharePoint Server 2013
  
Field Types XML markup is used to define information about a field that is needed to render the field in the UI and in visual designers, regardless of whether the rendering is done by a user control (ASCX), an XSLT template, or a (now Obsolete) **RenderPattern**.
