# Property element (View)

**Applies to:** SharePoint 2016 | SharePoint Foundation 2013 | SharePoint Online | SharePoint Server 2013
  
Returns the property from the context of the current [ForEach](foreach-element-view.md) loop. When a view or field is selected, the **Property** element can be used to retrieve a specific attribute value from it. 
  
```XML
<Property
  AutoHyperLink = "TRUE" | "FALSE"
  AutoHyperLinkNoEncoding = "TRUE" | "FALSE"
  AutoNewLine = "TRUE" | "FALSE"
  Default = "Text"
..ExpandXML = "TRUE" | "FALSE"
  HTMLEncode = "TRUE" | "FALSE"
  Name = "Text"
  OuterLookupField = "TRUE" | "FALSE"
  Select = "Text"
  StripWS = "TRUE" | "FALSE"
  URLEncode = "TRUE" | "FALSE"
  URLEncodeAsURL = "TRUE" | "FALSE">
</Property>
```

## Elements and attributes

The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.

### Attributes

|**Attribute**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**AutoHyperLink** <br/> |Optional **Boolean**. **TRUE** to surround text with `<A>` tags if the text appears like a hyperlink (for example, www.microsoft.com).  <br/> |
|**AutoHyperLinkNoEncoding** <br/> |Optional **Boolean**. **TRUE** to surround text with `<A>` tags if the text appears like a hyperlink (for example, www.microsoft.com) but without HTML encoding.  <br/> |
|**AutoNewLine** <br/> |Optional **Boolean**. **TRUE** to insert `<BR>` tags into the text stream and to replace multiple spaces with a nonbreaking space (`&nbsp;`).  <br/> |
|**Default** <br/> |Optional **Text**. Renders the text assigned to this attribute if the value returned by a selection is an empty string (`""`).  <br/> |
|**ExpandXML** <br/> |Optional **Boolean**. **TRUE** to re-pass the rendered content through the Collaborative Application Markup Language (CAML) interpreter, which allows CAML to render CAML.  <br/> |
|**HTMLEncode** <br/> |Optional **Boolean**. **TRUE** to convert embedded characters so that they are displayed as text in the browser. In other words, characters that could be confused with HTML tags are converted to entities.  <br/> |
|**Name** <br/> |Optional **Text**. Specifies the name of the property.  <br/> |
|**OuterLookupField** <br/> |Optional **Text**. Used in field definitions  <br/> |
|**Select** <br/> |Required **Text**. Specifies the name of the property to select.  <br/> |
|**StripWS** <br/> |Optional **Boolean**. **TRUE** to remove white space from the beginning and end of the value returned by the element.  <br/> |
|**URLEncode** <br/> |Optional **Boolean**. **TRUE** to convert special characters, such as spaces, to quoted UTF-8 format (for example, `%c3%ab` for character `Ã«`).  <br/> |
|**URLEncodeAsURL** <br/> |Optional **Boolean**. Like **URLEncode**, but **TRUE** to specify that the string to encode is a path component of a URL so that forward slashes (`/`) are not encoded.  <br/> |
   
### Child elements

None
   
### Parent elements

Numerous 
   
### Occurrences

- Minimum: 0
- Maximum: Unbounded 
   
### Remarks

The line `<Property Select="."/>` returns the body of the element in the schema that is being enumerated. For example, within a **ForEach** statement such as `<ForEach Select="CHOICES/CHOICE">` specifying  `<Property Select="."/>` would return the text of one of the conditionals. 
  
If a property cannot be found, a subelement of the current element in the schema enumeration is evaluated whose name is equal to the text specified by **Select**. For example, if a **Field** element has no property called **Default**, `<Property Select="Default"/>` will also search for a subelement called **Default** and render its body text if found. 
  
## Example

The following line of code returns the **Name** property from the current field or view. 
  
```XML
<Property Select="Name"/>
```
