# Support and feedback

The SharePoint product team responds to the developer community across several channels.

## Programming questions

**GitHub sp-dev-docs**: We regularly monitor questions submitted to the [GitHub sp-dev-docs issue list](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-docs/issues). Follow the [guidance](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-docs/wiki/How-to-Create-Good-Issues) on creating a good issue.

**Stack Overflow**: We listen and respond on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/microsoft-teams). Follow the [guidance](http://stackoverflow.com/tour) about what makes a good question on Stack Overflow.

[Tag your question](https://stackoverflow.com/tags) with one of the many `sharepoint` or `spfx` tags so that our team and the SharePoint developer community can spot your question.

## Documentation bugs

If you find a bug in the SharePoint developer documentation, open an [issue](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-docs/issues) on GitHub. Be sure to tell us which topic is factually incorrect or unclear.

To help us fix the problem more quickly, quote the text to be changed.

## Sample application bugs

If you find a bug in one of our samples. Please leave a comment on the sample (if it's in the documentation site) or open an issue (if it's in a sample within one of the [GitHub repositories we maintain](community/repositories.md)).

Be sure to describe the steps to reproduce the bug.

## Feature requests

If our platform doesn't empower you to do what you need, or if you have an idea for a new feature, or change to an existing, please make your features suggestions on the [Microsoft SharePoint Dev Platform feedback portal](https://feedbackportal.microsoft.com/feedback/forum/06735c62-321c-ec11-b6e7-0022481f8472).
