# SharePoint development

Build apps, add-ins, and solutions for SharePoint for your enterprise or customer needs.

## SharePoint Framework

The SharePoint Framework (SPFx) is a page and web part model that provides full support for client-side SharePoint development, easy integration with SharePoint data, and support for open source tooling. With the SharePoint Framework, you can use modern web technologies and tools in your preferred development environment to build productive experiences and apps that are responsive and mobile-ready from day one.

## SharePoint REST service

Interact with SharePoint data by using any technology that supports REST web requests. Perform Create,  Read,  Update, and  Delete (CRUD) operations from your SharePoint Add-ins, solutions, and client applications, using REST web technologies and standard Open Data Protocol (OData) syntax.
