# Support

This step talks about how to get help for the open source SharePoint modernization guidance and provide some ideas about potential next steps.

## Getting help

For questions on this deck and on the used scripts the best place to get help is the issue list in the sp-dev-modernization GitHub repository: https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-modernization/issues.

You’ve added a cool extension, fixed a type, fixed a bug…any contribution to the existing content that you can share back will help the SharePoint community:

- Sharing can be done by creating a Pull Request against the dev branch of the https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-modernization repository.
- If you’re unfamiliar with Git you can also describe the change in the issue list.

## What's next?

What else can you consider combining with the modernization:

- Make the Teams experience richer by populating the created Teams team with channels and messages. See https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/pnp-provisioning-tenant-templates on how to get started with PnP Tenant templates that provision Teams content.
- Create SharePoint Framework based customizations to replace existing, business critical, classic customizations. The customizations can also be hosted in Teams. See https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/spfx/sharepoint-framework-overview to learn more.
