### Key takeaways from this report
Load the ModernListBlocked.csv into Microsoft Excel and use below filters to analyze the received data

Filter | Takeaway
---------|----------
**No filter** | Will give you **all** the lists for which the default view page will not present itself using the "modern" UI. The number of lists can be very high because not all lists are designed to use the "modern" user interface. This data is however useful to assess the impact of upcoming "modern" changes: e.g. this report will tell you that x lists are not showing in modern because feature y is not available...if you know that feature y will become available in the future you can assess how many additional lists will then be able to present themselves using the "modern" user interface.
**Blocked at site level = TRUE or Blocked at web level = TRUE** | Using this filter you'll get all the sites where the "modern" ui blocking site/web scoped feature was enabled. It might be that this was done because certain sites were not yet ready for "modern", using this data you can disable the "modern" ui blocking feature again.
**Blocked at list level = TRUE** | End users do have the option to turn on/off the "modern" experience per list and using this filter you'll learn where that happened. The column "list experience" will show which setting was applied.
**Only blocked by OOB reaons = FALSE** | Will give you all the lists which are not rendering in "modern" because of a reason you can influence. If you want to improve the "modern" user interface compatibility of your SharePoint Online lists then these are the lists you can work with. 
**Only blocked by OOB reaons = FALSE and (Blocked by JSLink = TRUE or Blocked by XslLink = TRUE or Blocked by Xsl = TRUE or Blocked by JSLink field = TRUE)** | These are all the lists which are not showing in modern because their rendering is impacted by the existence of custom JavaScript or XSL. You could remove the references to these JavaScript and XSL files and go back to the out of the box way of list rendering or alternatively you can use column/view formatters or custom SharePoint Framework development.
**Only blocked by OOB reaons = FALSE and Blocked by list custom action = TRUE** | If a list custom action is embedding JavaScript then that will prevent rendering of the "modern" user interface. You can remove this list custom action or alternatively you can use column/view formatters or custom SharePoint Framework development.
**Business data fields = true or Blocked by task outcome field = true or Blocked by geo location field = true or Blocked by publishingField = true** | Although you can't fix the rendering of these fields you do have the option to remove them from the list default view which will fix the list "modern" rendering.
