# Modernization partner guidance

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Modernization tooling and all other PnP components are open-source tools backed by an active community providing support for them. There is no SLA for open-source tool support from official Microsoft support channels.

If you are a partner that will be running SharePoint modernization engagements for your customers or if you are a customer that will be working on modernization then continue reading. The modernization partner guidance is an offering that takes you on a step by step journey with as end goal modernized site collections. The focus of this guidance is on collaboration site modernization, if you want to modernize classic publishing portals then please check out the [Modernize publishing portals](modernize-publishing-portal.md) page.

The used approach is structured around 4 steps:

## Step 1: Assessment

Understanding which sites are candidates to be modernized is needed to understand the scope of the work. During the assessment phase you'll learn how to run the [SharePoint Modernization scanner](https://aka.ms/sppnp-modernizationscanner).

## Step 2: Strategy

This step provides a detailed explanation of how a classic SharePoint site will be transformed to a modern SharePoint site. Next to that it will touch upon key topics like Office 365 Group naming strategy, setting up tenant themes and configuring [Office 365 Learning Pathways](https://aka.ms/learningpathways).

## Step 3: Execution

Next is using the scan results from step 1 to build your modernization plan: you'll learn how to use the scan output to identify the sites to modernize and how to structure them in waves. Next you'll review and tailor the modernization scrips, prepare and validate the input for these scripts and finally run the modernization scripts.

## Step 4: Support

The final step talks about how to get help for the open source partner guidance and provide some ideas about potential next steps.
