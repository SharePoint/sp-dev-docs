You can modernize your sites by using the foreseen user interface options, like for connecting your site to an Office 365 Group. Using the user interface works great for a limited set of sites, if you have to modernize multiple sites it's recommended to automate the modernization. To help you with that you can find all our modernization tools, script and solutions in the [sp-dev-modernization](https://aka.ms/sppnp-modernization-git) open source repository, including [sample scripts that will help you automate your modernization tasks](https://aka.ms/sppnp-modernization-scripts).

The scripts section in the [sp-dev-modernization](https://aka.ms/sppnp-modernization-git) open source repository contains several categories of scripts:

Category | Description
---------|------------
[Office 365 Group Connect](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-modernization/tree/dev/Scripts/O365GroupConnect) | Contains scripts that show how to perform a bulk Office 365 Group connect. This is useful when you want to group connect multiple site collections instead of leaving group connect as a task for your site owners.
[Page transformation](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-modernization/tree/dev/Scripts/PageTransformation) | Here you find scripts that help you with page transformation of wiki, webpart, blog and publishing pages. There are scripts for transforming from SharePoint Online to SharePoint Online, but also scripts that handle transformation from SharePoint On-premises to SharePoint Online.
[Modernize site collections](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-modernization/tree/dev/Scripts/ModernizeSiteCollection) | These scripts are modernizing a site collection by combining Office 365 Group Connect, page transformation, cleaning up branding, creating a Teams team,... The scripts can work for a single site collection, but you can also provide a list of site collections to be modernized.
[List and Libraries](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-modernization/tree/dev/Scripts/ListsAndLibraries) | If you even needed to force certain site collections to show all lists using their classic rendering, then these scripts will do that for you.
