# Modernization guidance for existing SharePoint Add-In model implementations in Microsoft 365

The SharePoint Add-In model was introduced as part of the SharePoint 2013 timeframe and it was also provided as an extensibility option for SharePoint Online (Microsoft 365). 

[!INCLUDE [sp-Add-In-deprecation](../../includes/snippets/sp-add-in-deprecation.md)]

While SharePoint Add-In model is currently still supported in SharePoint Online, the model and patterns are outdated and aren't recommended to be used.

> [!NOTE] 
> This upcoming deprecation announcement will impact SharePoint Online. There are no changes on the Add-In model supportability within the SharePoint on-premises versions.

These upcoming changes are impacting SharePoint Add-In model and also authentication patterns using the classic [SharePoint Online hosted Microsoft Azure Access Control Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/sp-Add-Ins/authorization-code-oauth-flow-for-sharepoint-Add-Ins) (ACS) authentication patterns, used with the provided hosted Add-Ins and potentially with other unattended services connecting to SharePoint Online.

## Transformation technologies

Here's a high level table of the feature mapping as the Add-In model implementation is transformed to use other long term supported features:

| Classic technology 	       | New technology
|--------------------	       |----------------
| SharePoint Add-In          | SharePoint Framework
| Provider hosted Add-In     | Azure AD registered apps
| App registration using ACS | Azure AD registered apps
| JSOM                       | Graph JS SDK & PnPjs library
| SharePoint Workflow        | Power Automate Flows
