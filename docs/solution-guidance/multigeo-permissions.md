# Permission model in OneDrive and SharePoint Online Multi-Geo Preview

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> OneDrive and SharePoint Online Multi-Geo is currently in preview and subject to change.

The permission model in a OneDrive and SharePoint Online Multi-Geo Preview tenant is the same as that for a single geo tenant.

A Multi-Geo tenant has a single Azure AD environment distributed across all all geo locations. This Azure AD environment includes: 

- All users and groups - If you grant a user or group permissions, these permissions apply to all geo locations.
- All security principals - Whether you register your application in Azure AD using one of the Azure Portals, or via Azure Access Control Services (appregnew.aspx in SharePoint), the permissions granted apply to all geo locations.

The following image shows a Multi-Geo tenant with:

- A default geo location in North America
- A satellite geo location in Europe
- A satellite geo location in Asia

This tenant has one distributed Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) environment that includes all the users, groups, and permissions. The central Azure AD instance is distributed to all the geo locations.
