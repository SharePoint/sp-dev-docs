# Developing using Tenant permissions with App-Only in SharePoint Online

The developer experience has changed for SharePoint **Provider-hosted Add-ins** that require **Tenant permission in combination with app-only**. This article walks you through the new experience for developing and debugging these solutions.

_**Applies to:** Provider Hosted Add-ins for SharePoint Online_

## Understanding the Problem

In Visual Studio, you navigate to Debug, start debugging, and receive a message that "**Your tenant administrator has to approve this app**" as shown below.

The reason why you can't click **trust it** is because Visual Studio is working against the dev site collection you've specified in your project settings but tenant level permissions with app-only can only be granted via [trusting it against your tenant administration site](https://msdn.microsoft.com/pnp_articles/how-to-provide-add-in-app-only-tenant-administrative-permissions-in-sharepoint-online).

## Walkthrough

### Step 1: Create a new service principal

Navigate to a site collection in your tenant and generate a new client ID and Secret. (for example, `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/appregnew.aspx`). In this page click **Generate** for both the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** Fields and supply the remaining fields. While you're developing the add-in, ensure you use `localhost` including the port as the App Domain. You should have something similar as below.

### Step 2: Grant Tenant Permissions

To do this step, you must be a SharePoint Online Administrator.

Navigate to the SharePoint Admin Center (for example, `https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/appinv.aspx`) and grant the tenant permissions

### Step 3: Update your manifest and web.config

In the Visual Studio solution, update the manifest and **web.config** with the client ID created in step 1.

![Set the app's client ID in the add-in's web.config](media/development-experience-tenant-apponly-permissions-in-spo-05.png)

### Step 4: Package the app and add the .app file to the App catalog

Right click on the SharePoint Add-in project and click publish.

Supply the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** created in Step 1.

![Set the client ID and secret in the add-in's identity dialog in Visual Studio](media/development-experience-tenant-apponly-permissions-in-spo-06.png)

Since you want to debug the add-in, ensure that you supply `https://localhost` including the port as shown below.

![Set the location to https://localhost for debugging](media/development-experience-tenant-apponly-permissions-in-spo-07.png)

Now deploy the add-in in the app catalog site.

### Step 5: Install your add-in in your developer site collection

Navigate to the developer site and add the app. Click on **App Details**.

![Select the app details link on the app](media/development-experience-tenant-apponly-permissions-in-spo-08.png)

If you selected on the app tile, you'll have to select on "**Find out why**" and request your app

![Request the app by completing the dialog](media/development-experience-tenant-apponly-permissions-in-spo-09.png)

Once the request has been submitted, the status will be in a pending state until the SharePoint Administrator or the app catalog Administrator approves the request. To approve the request, navigate to the app catalog, select App Requests, and approve the request.

![Approve or Reject App Request dialog](media/development-experience-tenant-apponly-permissions-in-spo-10.png)

Once the request has been approved, the add-in may now be installed.

### Step 6: Debug your Add-in

In Visual Studio, right-click your web project and select **Debug** Start new instance. Once started, navigate to your site and launch the add-in.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If for some reason your app package file changes you'll need to redeploy it to the app catalog and re-install it to your development site collection
> - If you're add-in has an appinstalled event receiver you'll need to ensure that you've done step 6 before you do step 5
