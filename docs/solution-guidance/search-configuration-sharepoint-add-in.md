Search configuration in the SharePoint Add-in model
===================================================

Summary
-------

The approach you take to configure search is different in the new SharePoint Add-in model than it was with Full Trust Code. In a typical Full Trust Code (FTC) / Farm Solution scenario, the SharePoint Server-side Object Model was used to configure search, and deployed via SharePoint Solutions.

In an SharePoint Add-in model scenario, you use the SharePoint Client-side Object Model (CSOM) or REST API to configure search. This pattern is commonly referred to as the *remote provisioning pattern*.

High-level guidelines
---------------------

As a rule of a thumb, we would like to provide the following high-level guidelines to configure search in the new SharePoint Add-in model.

- Use the SharePoint Client-side Object Model (CSOM) API to configure search whenever possible by importing and exporting search configuration settings.
- Not all search configuration settings are currently available via the SharePoint CSOM API.
	+ See the [Export and import customized search configuration settings in SharePoint Server 2013 (TechNet Article)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj871675.aspx#BKMK_2) for a list of search configuration settings that can be exported and imported.
	+ If a search configuration setting is not able to be set using the CSOM then the Administration user interface is required to set configuration values.
- The SharePoint REST API is not capable (at this time) of importing or exporting search configuration settings.

**Getting started**

The following sample demonstrates how to import and export search settings between SharePoint tenants, site collections and sites.
