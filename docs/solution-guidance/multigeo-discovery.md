# Discover a Multi-Geo configuration for a SharePoint tenant

> **Important:** OneDrive and SharePoint Online Multi-Geo is currently in preview and is subject to change.

When you're working with a SharePoint tenant, you'll need to be able to detect whether it's a Multi-Geo tenant, and identify the default and satellite geo locations. 

The following image shows a Multi-Geo tenant with:

- A default geo location in North America
- A satellite geo location in Europe
- A satellite geo location in Asia

Depending on your scenario, you can use one or a combination of the following APIs to access a Multi-Geo tenant site:

- **The Microsoft Graph API** - Multi-Geo aware. We recommend that you use Microsoft Graph to access Multi-Geo tenant sites. 
- **SharePoint CSOM API** - Not Multi-Geo aware. Depending on the scenario, you'll need to target the correct geo location (for example, to access a user profile or perform tenant API operations).
- **SharePoint REST API** - Typically this API is used in the context of a site URL, and therefore whether the tenant is Multi-Geo is not a factor. Some REST API scenarios (such as search or user profiles) might require you to make calls per geo location.

## Get Multi-Geo tenant configuration information

### Using the CSOM API

Obtaining the geo location of your tenant can be done via CSOM by using the `Tenant` class and the `GetTenantInstances` method as shown in below snippet:

```csharp
Tenant tenant = new Tenant(clientContext);
var tenantInstances = tenant.GetTenantInstances();
clientContext.Load(tenantInstances);
clientContext.ExecuteQuery();
```

### Using the Microsoft Graph API

You can get the geo location information for a tenant by using Microsoft Graph. The following example returns a collection with one object per geo location.

```
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites?filter=siteCollection/root%20ne%20null&select=webUrl,siteCollection
```

Example response for a Multi-Geo tenant:
```JSON
{
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#sites",
    "value": [
        {
            "webUrl": "https://contoso.sharepoint.com/",
            "siteCollection": {
                "dataLocationCode":"NAM",
                "hostname": "contoso.sharepoint.com"
            }
        },
        {
            "webUrl": "https://contosoeur.sharepoint.com/",
            "siteCollection": {
                "dataLocationCode":"EUR",
                "hostname": "contosoeur.sharepoint.com"
            }
        },
        {
            "webUrl": "https://contosoapc.sharepoint.com/",
            "siteCollection": {
                "dataLocationCode":"APC",
                "hostname": "contosoapc.sharepoint.com"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Discover whether your tenant is Multi-Geo 

You can use Microsoft Graph to discover whether a tenant is Multi-Geo since requests via Microsoft Graph to Multi-Geo tenants return more then one item in the collection. The following example shows the results of a Microsoft Graph call to a single-geo tenant.

<!-- Not sure where the output for a Multi-Geo tenant is. Provide a link? -->

```
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites?filter=siteCollection/root%20ne%20null&select=webUrl,siteCollection
```

Example response for a single-geo tenant:
```JSON
{
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#sites",
    "value": [
        {
            "webUrl": "https://singlegeotest.sharepoint.com/",
            "siteCollection": {
                "dataLocationCode":"",
                "hostname": "singlegeotest.sharepoint.com"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
