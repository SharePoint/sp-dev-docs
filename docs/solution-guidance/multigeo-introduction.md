# OneDrive and SharePoint Online Multi-Geo Preview

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> OneDrive and SharePoint Online Multi-Geo is currently in preview and is subject to change.

The OneDrive and SharePoint Online Multi-Geo Preview allows multinational corporations that are part of the preview and have one or more geographical locations, to expand their Office 365 ODSP tenancy to satisfy data residency requirements.

In a OneDrive and SharePoint Online Multi-Geo Preview configuration, your Office 365 tenant consists of a central location (also known as a default location) and one or more satellite geo (geographical) locations. A single tenancy spans one or more additional geo locations. Your tenant information, including geo locations, is stored in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

> [!NOTE] 
> OneDrive and SharePoint Online Multi-Geo Preview features are not designed to optimize performance. They are designed to meet data residency requirements.

The following are key terms related to the OneDrive and SharePoint Online Multi-Geo Preview:

- **Tenant**: An organizationâ€™s representation in Office 365, typically with one or more domains. For example, contoso.com.

- **Geo location (or instance)**: A Multi-Geo tenant can have multiple geo locations (or instances) associated with it. Resources such as mailboxes or drives can be stored in these locations. For example, Contoso is a OneDrive and SharePoint Online Multi-Geo Preview tenant with three geo locations: NAM, EUR, and APC.

- **Preferred Data Location (PDL)**: A property set by the Azure AD administrator for the user or group object that Office 365 services use to provision the corresponding data-at-rest resources (mailbox, OneDrive, groups sites, and so on).
