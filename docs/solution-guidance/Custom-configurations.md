### General recommendations

### Tenant properties

_**Applies to:** Office 365_

Tenant properties allow tenant administrators to add properties in the App Catalog that can be read by various SharePoint Framework components. The tenant properties are managed by tenant administrators by using the Microsoft SharePoint Online Management Shell, which is a PowerShell module to manage your SharePoint Online subscription in Office 365 or using the [Office 365 CLI](https://aka.ms/o365cli).
