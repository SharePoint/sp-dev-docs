# Search in a Multi-Geo tenant

In a Multi-Geo tenant, each geo location has its own search index, as well as its own independent search center. When a user searches, the query is fanned out to all the indexes, and the returned results are merged.

For example, a user in one geo location can search for content stored in another geo location, or for content on a SharePoint site thatâ€™s restricted to a different geo location. If the user has access to this content, search shows the result. 

To work programmatically with search in a Multi-Geo tenant, see [Get custom search applications to show results from all or some geo locations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise/configure-search-for-multi-geo#get-custom-search-applications-to-show-results-from-all-or-some-geo-locations).
