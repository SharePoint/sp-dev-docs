# Search in a Multi-Geo SharePoint tenant

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> OneDrive and SharePoint Online Multi-Geo is currently in preview and subject to change.

In a Multi-Geo SharePoint tenant, each geo location has its own search index, as well as its own independent search center. When a user searches, the query is fanned out to all the indexes, and the returned results are merged.

For example, a user in one geo location can search for content stored in another geo location, or for content on a SharePoint site thatâ€™s restricted to a different geo location. If the user has access to this content, search will show the result. 

By default, when you configure a search center, the search center uses the following URL pattern.

```
https://<tenanturl>.sharepoint.com/sites/search
```

In the scenario shown in the following image, a Multi-Geo tenant has three geo locations, each with a geo location-specific search URL.

|**Geo location**|**Search URL**|
|:---------------|:-------------|
|North America (default location)|https://contoso.sharepoint.com/search|
|Europe (satellite location)|https://contosoeur.sharepoint.com/search|
|Asia (satellite location)|https://contosoapc.sharepoint.com/search|
