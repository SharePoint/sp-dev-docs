# PnP remote provisioning

Learn about remote provisioning for your Office 365 and SharePoint Online site collections using features of the add-in model. Note that remote provisioning is also supported on SharePoint 2013 and SharePoint 2016.

Microsoft SharePoint 2013 and the new Add-in model allow you to use remote provisioning for your Office 365 and SharePoint Online site collections, as well as for SharePoint 2013 and SharePoint 2016. You can easily create a provisioning template, and then apply and reuse the template by using simple Windows PowerShell scripts or C# code.
