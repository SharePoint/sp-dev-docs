# PnP remote provisioning

Microsoft SharePoint and the new SharePoint Add-in model allow you to use remote provisioning for your Office 365, SharePoint, and SharePoint Online site collections. You can easily create a provisioning template, and then apply and reuse the template by using simple Windows PowerShell scripts or C# code.

See the following audio/video introduction to the PnP provisioning engine delivered by Paolo Pialorsi.
