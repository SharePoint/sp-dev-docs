# Connect to new Office 365 group: CSOM development

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The option to connect an Office 365 group to an existing site is **not** yet available and will be released during Q2 of calendar year 2018.

The SharePoint client-side object model (CSOM) provides access to the SharePoint object model from code that is running locally or on a different server than SharePoint.    

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure that you're familiar with the following:

- [Using the Client Object Model](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff798388.aspx)
- [Common Programming Tasks in the Managed Client Object Model](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee537013.aspx)

You also need to reference the [Microsoft.SharePointOnline.CSOM](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.SharePointOnline.CSOM/) NuGet package (version 16.1.6906.1200 or later).

## CSOM code example

The following example shows how to create a __Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.TenantAdministration.Tenant__ object and call the __GetAllTenantThemes__ method to return a list of themes. 

> [!NOTE]
> * The URL used to create the context object includes the _-admin_ suffix, because **TenantAdministration** methods work with the admin site.
> * Create a __Tenant__ instance with the [Tenant constructor](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn174852.aspx), and then call the methods on that instance.

```csharp
using System.Security;
using Microsoft.SharePoint.Client;
using Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.TenantAdministration;
using Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.TenantManagement;

...

ClientContext ctx = new ClientContext("https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com/");
var pwd = "mypassword";
var passWord = new SecureString();
foreach (char c in pwd.ToCharArray()) passWord.AppendChar(c);
ctx.Credentials = new SharePointOnlineCredentials("admin@mydomain.com", passWord);
Tenant tenant = new Tenant(ctx);
tenant.CreateGroupForSite("https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/team-site", "display-name-for-group", "alias-for-group", true);
```


## Methods in Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.TenantAdministration.Tenant class

Use the following methods to customize the set of available themes for a SharePoint tenant administration site. You can add a new custom theme, update an existing theme, or delete a theme, and you can retrieve a specific theme or all themes. You can also hide or restore the default themes that come with SharePoint.

### CreateGroupForSite method

Create a new Office 365 group and attach it to an existing site. After this succeeds for a given site, calling it again with the same site will throw an Exception.
