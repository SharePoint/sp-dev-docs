# PowerShell cmdlets for SharePoint hub sites

Use PowerShell cmdlets to create and manage SharePoint hub sites.

## Get started

To run the PowerShell cmdlets:

1. Download and install the [SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=35588). If you already have a previous version of the shell installed, uninstall it first, and then install the latest version.

2. Follow the instructions at [Connect to SharePoint Online PowerShell](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/fp161372.aspx) to connect to your SharePoint tenant.

To verify your setup, try using the **Get-SPOHubSite** cmdlet to read the current list of hub sites. If the cmdlet runs and returns with no errors, you're ready to proceed.
