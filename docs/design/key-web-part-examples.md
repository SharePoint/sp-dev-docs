# Key web part examples

This is a visual overview of Communication site and Team site templates, highlighting how web parts work together to create a coherent overall design. Use these pages as reference when designing a SharePoint web part. It is important to consider how the web part will look and function when sitting next to other web parts on a page. Follow the patterns in this documentation and on the [Office UI Fabric site](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric) to ensure consistency in layout and grid alignment, font size and hierarchy, commanding, empty states and more.
