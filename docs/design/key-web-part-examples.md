# Key web part examples

Web parts are the building blocks of your page. 

This is a visual overview of Communication site and Team site templates, highlighting how web parts work together to create a coherent overall design. Use these pages as reference when designing a SharePoint web part. 

It is important to consider how the web part will look and function when sitting next to other web parts on a page. Follow the patterns in this documentation and on the [Office UI Fabric site](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric) to ensure consistency in layout and grid alignment, font size and hierarchy, commanding, empty states, and more.

## Communication sites

### Topic design

The Topic design is used when you have a lot of information to share, such as news, events, reports, and other content. It is built from the Hero, News, Events, Highlighted content, Quick links, and People web parts.

### Showcase design

The Showcase design is used to feature a product, team, or event. It leverages the Hero and Image gallery web parts to show rich visual content.
