# Designing a web part icon

Web Part icons are designed to be simple, representative, and symbolic. Every icon is reduced to a minimalistic style to represent the most essential attributes. Icons will display in the toolbox within SharePoint pages and optionally in the store.

## Grid keyline shapes

Web parts icons are displayed at 32x32 px but designed at 2x the size or 64x64px. Create icons at 100% to ensure pixels are accurate.

## Layout

Icons should be designed inside of the 64 x 64 pixel container area, to insure that the icons renders correctly.

## Shapes

Not all icons or logos are designed in a perfect square. Use this guide of basic shapes to understand how to unify different icon shapes within the grid and appear at a proportional size. Make sure that the icon fills either the full width or height of the grid depending on its shape.

## Pixel clarity

Try to avoid any icon distortion by snapping your edges to the X and Y coordinates. Use whole numbers when possible.

## Colors and backgrounds

The icon is the visual expression of your web part and its function. They can help communicate the core idea of your web part simply and boldly.

Web part icons can contain one color or be full color. Most icons work best when using extremely simplified shapes, thin two-pixel lines similar to the Office UI Fabric icons. In some cases there may be a need to use a company brand icon or logo mark in full color. If there is a one color version of the icon available consider using this version first.

## Exporting your icons

Icons should be exported as SVGs at 64x64 px and should have transparent backgrounds.

You can find the icon grid in the [SharePoint Design toolkit](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#/resources).
