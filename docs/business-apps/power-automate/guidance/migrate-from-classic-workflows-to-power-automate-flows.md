# Guidance: Migrate from classic workflows to Power Automate flows in SharePoint

## Current landscape

For business users building apps and process automations in SharePoint today and into the future, Microsoft **Power Apps** and *flows* within Microsoft **Power Automate** are your tools of choice. This natural transition is well underway as SharePoint evolves from InfoPath and SharePoint Designer workflows to the simplicity and versatility of Power Apps and flows within Power Automate.

This article specifically provides guidance about how to plan for transitioning from classic SharePoint Workflows to Power Automate flows.

## Classic workflows in SharePoint

Classic workflows in SharePoint constitutes two workflow systems namely

- SharePoint 2010 workflow
- SharePoint 2013 workflow

While both workflow systems allow users to build and publish workflows in SharePoint, see the following key differences:

- SharePoint 2010 workflows, released along with SharePoint Server 2010, are hosted, and executed in SharePoint workflow runtime.

- SharePoint 2013 workflows, released along with SharePoint Server 2013, are hosted in SharePoint, and executed in Workflow Manager, that runs independently.

Users primarily use SharePoint Designer to author and publish workflows in SharePoint, while professional developers, looking to extend and build workflows, use Visual Studio to build and publish workflows in SharePoint.

## Modern workflows with Power Automate flows

Since the release of classic workflows, SharePoint and Microsoft 365 apps have evolved to provide compelling, flexible and more performant experiences. Modern experiences in SharePoint integrate with rest of the Microsoft 365 apps and services driving security, productivity, and collaboration.

[Power Automate](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-automate/getting-started) helps users and businesses to create automated workflows between your favorite apps and services to get notifications, collect data, automate business policies and more.

Using Microsoft Power Automate, SharePoint users can use the SharePoint Connector to create automations for when data changes in a list or a library. Users can build simple to complex workflows such as, but not limited to:

- Send an email when a new item is created in a list.

- Start approval when a new file is added in a library.

To create and author flows, users primarily use [Power Automate website](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/) while users can also [create flows from within SharePoint](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-flow-for-a-list-or-library-in-sharepoint-or-onedrive-a9c3e03b-0654-46af-a254-20252e580d01?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) or using the [Power Automate mobile app](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-automate/mobile-create-flow).

## Pain points in moving between classic workflows in SharePoint and Power Automate flows

Many people feel there are significant gaps between SharePoint Designer (classic) workflows and Power Automate flows, but the list is not long. Of course, there are some workarounds you should consider in your planning as you move from classic workflows to Power Automate flows.
	
- **30 day run limit for flows** – SharePoint Designer workflows can run endlessly, but flows have a 30 day lifespan. Getting beyond this limitation means your flow will need to call itself in a re-entrant way to restart the clock ticking.
- **HTTP Connector** – If you make calls to SharePoint's REST API, then you can use  the ['Send HTTP Request to SharePoint'](../guidance/working-with-send-sp-http-request.md) action available in the SharePoint connector. Flow also has a generic HTTP connector (as an action), but it is a Premium connector. If you use HTTP calls extensively, you may want to create a “service account” user with a Power Automate license and run these flows with that user account. This also will make it easier to manage the set of flows you consider "enterprise" flows. 
- **Reusable Flows** – Using some modular thinking, you can create a master flow which a flow per list or library can call to do the heavy lifting. (In some ways this is even preferable, as you can edit a flow which is used in many locations centrally.) Alternatively, you can use flow actions to discover all of the lists or libraries which match some criteria and run the flow on them all on a timer rather than based on events.
- **Workflow history storage** – Flows maintain a history in the context of the flow itself in the Power Automate dashboard. If you need tracking in your sites, you can have the flow log information in a list you create.
- **Impersonation** - In SharePoint 2010 workflows, you can add an impersonation step to act as a different user. This capability is not readily available in flows.

While these pain points do exist, you can see there are workarounds for each of them.

## Modern approvals with Power Automate flows

Approvals are the most common workflow scenario when it comes to automating business processes in SharePoint. Transitioning to Power Automate flows, approvals can be streamlined for data in SharePoint, Dynamics 365, forms, SQL, and so on. You can create approvals in your workflow, and view sent and received requests in a unified Actions center. Power Automate approvals enable users to customize flows and create approvals for the following types:

- [Single approvals](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-automate/modern-approvals)

- [Sequential approvals](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-automate/sequential-modern-approvals)

- [Parallel approvals](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-automate/parallel-modern-approvals)

SharePoint approvals such as [page approvals](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/business-apps/power-automate/guidance/customize-page-approvals), [document approvals](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/business-apps/power-automate/guidance/require-doc-approval), and [hub association approvals](https://support.microsoft.com/office/set-up-your-sharepoint-hub-site-e2daed64-658c-4462-aeaf-7d1a92eba098#bkmk_managesiteassociationapprovals) are all integrated and powered by Power Automate flows, providing users the flexibility to customize the business process for each of the approval scenarios.

## Authoring classic workflows and flows

To fully understand the improvements of authoring workflows with flows in Power Automate and classic workflows using SharePoint Designer, users must first familiarize themselves with the workflow terminologies used by the workflow tools; that is, SharePoint Designer and Power Automate.

To author workflows, as outlined in the previous sections, users primarily use SharePoint Designer to author classic workflows and Power Automate website portal to author flows.

See the following tables that compare the workflow terminologies, triggers, and actions for most common workflow concepts and support.

While the following lists show some of the most common workflow capabilities, Power Automate offers many more features, and is actively updated with new features. We highly recommend visiting the following Power Automate websites for guided learning:
