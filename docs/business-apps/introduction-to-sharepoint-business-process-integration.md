# SharePoint custom forms and automated business workflow

Creativity and teamwork are essential to transforming business process. Most processes center on content – files and data. SharePoint gives you tools to gather and manage data in lists and libraries.  

Office 365 provides connections to a range of third-party systems with Microsoft Flow and PowerApps. Flow lets you easily automate business processes and PowerApps lets you create great forms and mobile apps based on SharePoint files and data. Both PowerApps and Flow feature intuitive visual designers, so anyone can craft forms and screens in an easy-to-use interface.

## Microsoft Flow

Using Microsoft Flow, you can create workflows through an easy-to-use visual designer that will guide you through each step and help authenticate your accounts.

Select from dozens of pre-made templates also available in Flow to start automating your app’s usage. Here are just a few applications of these templates:

* Create a new record in Dynamics CRM when a new list item is added to a SharePoint list.
* Copy new members from MailChimp lists to SharePoint lists.
* Move files to different folders after they’re approved in SharePoint.
* Create a new item in SharePoint when a new order is added in Salesforce.
* Route finished documents to a team for approval

Whether you start with a template or begin from scratch, using Flow to create automation features is intuitive and easy to understand.

Cross-tool functionality seamlessly moves your data from one operation to another. Since SharePoint is a core piece of the Office 365 suite,your data easily integrates with tools like Excel or Power BI reporting. And since it uses an Excelinspired expression language, these tools talk with each other, using formula language you already recognize and understand to integrate your data from one function to the next.

## Microsoft PowerApps

Using Microsoft PowerApps, you can create apps with a point-and-click approach to app design. You can use the option to use automatically generated pre-made templates or customize the tool to fit your more specific needs. Then, once your app is complete, you can instantly publish it to Windows, the web, iOS, and Android.  

Classic mobile and web apps typically required separate coding for each platform, which can be costly and time-consuming to do—especially since programmers are currently in high demand. Instead, PowerApps simplifies the process so anyone can do it. Its easy-to-use, browser-based visual designer helps you rapidly build custom business apps without having to write any code.

By connecting PowerApps to your existing systems and data, you can quickly build reports, forms, and workflows, then publish your app instantly to all users in your organization.

PowerApps also allows you to easily customize the form for a SharePoint list. With custom forms, you can, for example:

* Show or hide certain fields
* Re-organize those fields
* Change the layout of the form
* Add formatted text and graphics

When you publish your changes, the form is embedded within the SharePoint list for use by all of its users.
