## Automate business processes
Office 365 provides connections to a range of third-party systems with Power Automate and Power Apps. Power Automate lets you easily automate business processes while Power Apps lets you create exceptional forms and mobile apps based on SharePoint files and data.

Using Power Automate, you can create workflows through an easy-to-use visual designer that will guide you through each step and help authenticate your accounts.

Select from dozens of pre-made templates to start automating your app’s usage. Here are just a few applications of these templates:

* Create a new record in Microsoft Dynamics CRM when a new list item is added to a SharePoint list.
* Copy new members from MailChimp lists to SharePoint lists.
* Move files to different folders after they’re approved in SharePoint.
* Create a new item in SharePoint when a new order is added in Salesforce.
* Route finished documents to a team for approval.

Cross-tool functionality seamlessly moves your data from one operation to another. SharePoint is a core piece of the Microsoft 365 suite integrating your data seamlessly with tools like Excel or Power BI reporting. And because it uses an Excel-inspired expression language, these tools communicate with each other, using formula language you already recognize to integrate your data from one function to the next.

## Build business apps
Using Microsoft Power Apps, you can create apps with a point-and-click approach to app design. You can use the option to use automatically generated pre-made templates, or customize the tool to fit your more specific needs. After your app is complete, you can instantly publish it to Windows, the web, iOS, and Android.  

Classic mobile and web apps typically required separate coding for each platform, which can be costly and time-consuming to do—especially since developers are in such high demand. Instead, Power Apps simplifies the process so anyone can do it. Its simple, browser-based visual designer helps you rapidly build custom business apps without having to write any code.

By connecting Power Apps to your existing systems and data, you can quickly build reports, forms, and workflows, then publish your app instantly to all users in your organization.

Power Apps also lets you to easily customize the form for a SharePoint list. With custom forms, you can, for example:

* Show or hide certain fields.
* Re-organize those fields.
* Change the layout of the form.
