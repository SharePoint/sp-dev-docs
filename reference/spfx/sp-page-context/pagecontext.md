# PageContext class







The page context provides standard definitions for common SharePoint objects that need to be shared between the client-side application, web parts, and other components. Typically the data is fetched via REST queries when navigating to a new page, but it can also be preloaded by the web server, or filled from a custom application cache.

## Properties

| Property	   | Access Modifier | Type	| Description|
|:-------------|:----|:-------|:-----------|
|`cultureInfo`     | `public` | [`CultureInfo`](../sp-page-context/cultureinfo.md) | _Read-only._ It provides culture info for the current user of the application. This class is primarily used with the PageContext class. |
|`isInitialized`     | `public` | `boolean` | _Read-only._ Returns whether the PageContext has been initialized. |
|`legacyPageContext`     | `public` | `any` | _Read-only._ This property is provided to facilitate migration of legacy code. It returns a JavaScript object whose contents are similar to the _spPageContextInfo window variable from classic pages. The contents of this variable may change in future releases of SharePoint.
