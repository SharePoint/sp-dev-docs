# onPropertyPaneRendered()
**Note:** The SharePoint Framework is currently in preview and is subject to change. SharePoint Framework client-side web parts are not currently supported for use in production environments.



This API is invoked when the PropertyPane is rendered. From framework standpoint, we do not want to allow this event handler to be passed in, and trigger it. This api should be deprecated and then removed as part of refactoring.

**Signature:** _@virtual protected onPropertyPaneRendered(): void;_

**Returns**: `void`

None
