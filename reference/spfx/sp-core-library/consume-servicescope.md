# consume(serviceKey)




Components should call this function to "consume" a dependency, i.e. look up the serviceKey and return the registered service instance. If the instance cannot be found, then a default instance will be autocreated and registered with the root ServiceScope.

**Signature:** _public consume < T >(serviceKey: [ServiceKey](../sp-core-library/servicekey.md)<T>): T;_

**Returns**: `T`



- the service instance
