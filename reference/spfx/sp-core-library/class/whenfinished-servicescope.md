# whenFinished(callback)
**Note:** The SharePoint Framework is currently in preview and is subject to change. SharePoint Framework client-side web parts are not currently supported for use in production environments.



It is an error to call ServiceScope.consume() before finish() has been called. The most reliable way to protect your component against this error is to perform the consume() calls inside a whenFinished() callback. If the service scope is already finished, then the callback will be executed immediately; otherwise, it will be executed later when the scope is finished.

**Signature:** _public whenFinished(callback: () => void): void;_

**Returns**: `void`
