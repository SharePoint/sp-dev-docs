# SPHttpClient class







SPHttpClient is used to perform REST calls against SharePoint. It adds default headers, manages the digest needed for writes, and collects telemetry that helps the service to monitor the performance of an application. For communicating with non-SharePoint services, use the HttpClient class instead.


## Constructor

## Properties

| Property	   | Access Modifier | Type	| Description|
|:-------------|:----|:-------|:-----------|
|`serviceKey`     | `public` | [`ServiceKey`](../sp-core-library/servicekey.md)<[`SPHttpClient`](../sp-http/sphttpclient.md)> | The service key for SPHttpClient. |




## Methods

| Method	   | Access Modifier | Returns	| Description|
|:-------------|:----|:-------|:-----------|
|[`beginBatch()`](beginbatch-sphttpclient.md)     | `public` | `SPHttpClientBatch` | Begins an ODATA batch, which allows multiple REST queries to be bundled into a single web request. |
|[`fetch(url,configuration,options)`](fetch-sphttpclient.md)     | `public` | `Promise<SPHttpClientResponse>` | Generally, the parameters and semantics for SPHttpClient.fetch() are essentially the same as the WHATWG API standard that is documented here: https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/ The SPHttpClient subclass adds some additional behaviors that are convenient when working with SharePoint ODATA API's (which can be avoided by using HttpClient instead): - Default "Accept" and "Content-Type" headers are added if not explicitly specified. - For write operations, an "X-RequestDigest" header is automatically added - The request digest token is automatically fetched and stored in a cache, with support for preloading For a write operation, SPHttpClient will automatically add the "X-RequestDigest" header, which may need to be obtained by issuing a seperate request such as "https://example.com/sites/sample/_api/contextinfo". Typically the appropriate SPWeb URL can be guessed by looking for a reserved URL segment such as "_api" in the original URL passed to fetch(); if not, use ISPHttpClientOptions.webUrl to specify it explicitly. |
|[`get(url,configuration,options)`](get-sphttpclient.md)     | `public` | `Promise<SPHttpClientResponse>` | Calls fetch(), but sets the method to 'GET'. |
|[`getWebUrlFromRequestUrl(requestUrl)`](getweburlfromrequesturl-sphttpclient.md)     | `public, static` | `string` | This uses a heuristic to guess the SPWeb URL associated with the provided REST URL. This is necessary for operations such as the X-RequestDigest and ODATA batching, which require POSTing to a separate REST endpoint in order to complete a request. For excample, if the requestUrl is "/sites/site/web/_api/service", the returned URL would be "/sites/site/web". Or if the requestUrl is "http://example.com/_layouts/service", the returned URL would be "http://example.com". |
|[`post(url,configuration,options)`](post-sphttpclient.md)     | `public` | `Promise<SPHttpClientResponse>` | Calls fetch(), but sets the method to 'POST'. |
